<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

<h5>WITHOUT.</h5>


<p>Snow. Everywhere. As far as the eye could reach&mdash;fifty
miles, looking southward from the highest white peak,&mdash;filling
ravines and gulches, and dropping from the walls of cañons
in white shroud-like drifts, fashioning the dividing ridge into
the likeness of a monstrous grave, hiding the bases of giant
pines, and completely covering young trees and larches,
rimming with porcelain the bowl-like edges of still, cold
lakes, and undulating in motionless white billows to the edge
of the distant horizon. Snow lying everywhere over the
California Sierras on the 15th day of March 1848, and still
falling.</p>

<p>It had been snowing for ten days: snowing in finely granulated
powder, in damp, spongy flakes, in thin, feathery plumes,
snowing from a leaden sky steadily, snowing fiercely, shaken
out of purple-black clouds in white flocculent masses, or
dropping in long level lines, like white lances from the
tumbled and broken heavens. But always silently! The
woods were so choked with it&mdash;the branches were so laden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
with it&mdash;it had so permeated, filled and possessed earth and
sky; it had so cushioned and muffled the ringing rocks and
echoing hills, that all sound was deadened. The strongest
gust, the fiercest blast, awoke no sigh or complaint from the
snow-packed, rigid files of forest. There was no cracking of
bough nor crackle of underbrush; the overladen branches of
pine and fir yielded and gave way without a sound. The
silence was vast, measureless, complete! Nor could it be
said that any outward sign of life or motion changed the fixed
outlines of this stricken landscape. Above, there was no
play of light and shadow, only the occasional deepening of
storm or night. Below, no bird winged its flight across the
white expanse, no beast haunted the confines of the black
woods; whatever of brute nature might have once inhabited
these solitudes had long since flown to the lowlands.</p>

<p>There was no track or imprint; whatever foot might have
left its mark upon this waste, each succeeding snow-fall
obliterated all trace or record. Every morning the solitude
was virgin and unbroken; a million tiny feet had stepped
into the track and filled it up. And yet, in the centre of
this desolation, in the very stronghold of this grim fortress,
there was the mark of human toil. A few trees had been
felled at the entrance of the cañon, and the freshly-cut chips
were but lightly covered with snow. They served, perhaps, to
indicate another tree "blazed" with an axe, and bearing a
rudely-shaped wooden effigy of a human hand, pointing to the
cañon. Below the hand was a square strip of canvas, securely
nailed against the bark, and bearing the following inscription&mdash;</p>

<p>

<span style="margin-left: 12.5em;">HELP!"</span><br />
</p>

<p>The language of suffering is not apt to be artistic or studied,
but I think that rhetoric could not improve this actual record.
So I let it stand, even as it stood this 15th day of March 1848,
half-hidden by a thin film of damp snow, the snow-whitened
hand stiffened and pointing rigidly to the fateful cañon like
the finger of Death.</p>

<p>At noon there was a lull in the storm, and a slight brightening
of the sky toward the east. The grim outlines of the
distant hills returned, and the starved white flank of the mountain
began to glisten. Across its gaunt hollow some black
object was moving&mdash;moving slowly and laboriously; moving
with such an uncertain mode of progression, that at first it was
difficult to detect whether it was brute or human&mdash;sometimes
on all fours, sometimes erect, again hurrying forward like a
drunken man, but always with a certain definiteness of purpose,
towards the cañon. As it approached nearer you saw that
it was a man&mdash;a haggard man, ragged and enveloped in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
tattered buffalo robe, but still a man, and a determined one.
A young man despite his bent figure and wasted limbs&mdash;a
young man despite the premature furrows that care and
anxiety had set upon his brow and in the corners of his rigid
mouth&mdash;a young man notwithstanding the expression of
savage misanthropy with which suffering and famine had
overlaid the frank impulsiveness of youth. When he reached
the tree at the entrance of the cañon, he brushed the film of
snow from the canvas placard, and then leaned for a few
moments exhaustedly against its trunk. There was something
in the abandonment of his attitude that indicated even
more pathetically than his face and figure his utter prostration&mdash;a
prostration quite inconsistent with any visible cause.
When he had rested himself, he again started forward with
a nervous intensity, shambling, shuffling, falling, stooping to
replace the rudely extemporised snow-shoes of fir bark that
frequently slipped from his feet, but always starting on again
with the feverishness of one who doubted even the sustaining
power of his will.</p>

<p>A mile beyond the tree the cañon narrowed and turned
gradually to the south, and at this point a thin curling cloud
of smoke was visible that seemed to rise from some crevice
in the snow. As he came nearer, the impression of recent
footprints began to show; there was some displacement of
the snow around a low mound from which the smoke now
plainly issued. Here he stopped, or rather lay down, before
an opening or cavern in the snow, and uttered a feeble
shout. It was responded to still more feebly. Presently a
face appeared above the opening, and a ragged figure like
his own, then another, and then another, until eight human
creatures, men and women, surrounded him in the snow,
squatting like animals, and like animals lost to all sense of
decency and shame.</p>

<p>They were so haggard, so faded, so forlorn, so wan,&mdash;so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
piteous in their human aspect, or rather all that was left of
a human aspect,&mdash;that they might have been wept over as
they sat there; they were so brutal, so imbecile, unreasoning
and grotesque in these newer animal attributes, that they
might have provoked a smile. They were originally country
people, mainly of that social class whose self-respect is apt
to be dependent rather on their circumstances, position and
surroundings, than upon any individual moral power or intellectual
force. They had lost the sense of shame in the
sense of equality of suffering; there was nothing within
them to take the place of the material enjoyments they were
losing. They were childish without the ambition or emulation
of childhood; they were men and women without the
dignity or simplicity of man and womanhood. All that
had raised them above the level of the brute was lost in the
snow. Even the characteristics of sex were gone; an old
woman of sixty quarrelled, fought, and swore with the harsh
utterance and ungainly gestures of a man; a young man of
scorbutic temperament wept, sighed, and fainted with the
hysteria of a woman. So profound was their degradation
that the stranger who had thus evoked them from the earth,
even in his very rags and sadness, seemed of another race.</p>

<p>They were all intellectually weak and helpless, but one, a
woman, appeared to have completely lost her mind. She
carried a small blanket wrapped up to represent a child&mdash;the
tangible memory of one that had starved to death in her
arms a few days before&mdash;and rocked it from side to side
as she sat, with a faith that was piteous. But even more
piteous was the fact that none of her companions took the
least notice, either by sympathy or complaint, of her aberration.
When, a few moments later, she called upon them
to be quiet, for that "baby" was asleep, they glared at her
indifferently and went on. A red-haired man, who was
chewing a piece of buffalo hide, cast a single murderous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
glance at her, but the next moment seemed to have forgotten
her presence in his more absorbing occupation.</p>

<p>The stranger paused a moment rather to regain his breath
than to wait for their more orderly and undivided attention.
Then he uttered the single word:</p>

<p>"Nothing!"</p>

<p>"Nothing!" They all echoed the word simultaneously,
but with different inflection and significance&mdash;one fiercely,
another gloomily, another stupidly, another mechanically.
The woman with the blanket baby explained to it, "he says
'nothing,'" and laughed.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;nothing," repeated the speaker. "Yesterday's
snow blocked up the old trail again. The beacon on the
summit's burnt out. I left a notice at the Divide. Do
that again, Dumphy, and I'll knock the top of your ugly
head off."</p>

<p>Dumphy, the red-haired man, had rudely shoved and
stricken the woman with the baby&mdash;she was his wife, and
this conjugal act may have been partly habit&mdash;as she was
crawling nearer the speaker. She did not seem to notice
the blow or its giver&mdash;the apathy with which these people
received blows or slights was more terrible than wrangling&mdash;but
said assuringly, when she had reached the side of
the young man&mdash;</p>

<p>"To-morrow, then?"</p>

<p>The face of the young man softened as he made the same
reply he had made for the last eight days to the same
question&mdash;</p>

<p>"To-morrow, surely!"</p>

<p>She crawled away, still holding the effigy of her dead
baby very carefully, and retreated down the opening.</p>

<p>"'Pears to me you don't do much anyway, out scouting!
'Pears to me you ain't worth shucks!" said the harsh-voiced
woman, glancing at the speaker. "Why don't some on ye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
take his place? Why do you trust your lives and the lives
of women to that thar Ashley?" she continued, with her
voice raised to a strident bark.</p>

<p>The hysterical young man, Henry March, who sat next
to her, turned a wild scared face upon her, and then, as if
fearful of being dragged into the conversation, disappeared
hastily after Mrs. Dumphy.</p>

<p>Ashley shrugged his shoulders, and, replying to the group,
rather than any individual speaker, said curtly&mdash;</p>

<p>"There's but one chance&mdash;equal for all&mdash;open to all.
You know what it is. To stay here is death; to go cannot
be worse than that."</p>

<p>He rose and walked slowly away up the cañon a few rods
to where another mound was visible, and disappeared from
their view. When he had gone, a querulous chatter went
around the squatting circle.</p>

<p>"Gone to see the old Doctor and the gal. We're no
account."</p>

<p>"Thar's two too many in this yer party."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;the crazy Doctor and Ashley."</p>

<p>"They're both interlopers, any way."</p>

<p>"Jonahs."</p>

<p>"Said no good could come of it, ever since we picked
him up."</p>

<p>"But the Cap'n invited the ol' Doctor, and took all his
stock at Sweetwater, and Ashley put in his provisions with
the rest."</p>

<p>The speaker was McCormick. Somewhere in the feeble
depths of his consciousness there was still a lingering sense
of justice. He was hungry, but not unreasonable. Besides,
he remembered with a tender regret the excellent quality
of provision that Ashley had furnished.</p>

<p>"What's that got to do with it?" screamed Mrs.
Brackett. "He brought the bad luck with him. Ain't my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
husband dead, and isn't that skunk&mdash;an entire stranger&mdash;still
livin'?"</p>

<p>The voice was masculine, but the logic was feminine.
In cases of great prostration with mental debility, in the
hopeless vacuity that precedes death by inanition or starvation,
it is sometimes very effective. They all assented to
it, and, by a singular intellectual harmony, the expression of
each was the same. It was simply an awful curse.</p>

<p>"What are you goin' to do?"</p>

<p>"If I was a man, I'd know!"</p>

<p>"Knife him!"</p>

<p>"Kill him, and"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The remainder of this sentence was lost to the others in
a confidential whisper between Mrs. Brackett and Dumphy.
After this confidence they sat and wagged their heads together,
like two unmatched but hideous Chinese idols.</p>

<p>"Look at his strength! and he not a workin' man like us,"
said Dumphy. "Don't tell me he don't get suthin' reg'lar."</p>

<p>"Suthin' what?"</p>

<p>"Suthin' TO EAT!"</p>

<p>But it is impossible to convey, even by capitals, the intense
emphasis put upon this verb. It was followed by a horrible
pause.</p>

<p>"Let's go and see."</p>

<p>"And kill him?" suggested the gentle Mrs. Brackett.</p>

<p>They all rose with a common interest almost like enthusiasm.
But after they had tottered a few steps, they fell.
Yet even then there was not enough self-respect left among
them to feel any sense of shame or mortification in their
baffled design. They stopped&mdash;all except Dumphy.</p>

<p>"Wot's that dream you was talkin' 'bout jess now?" said
Mr. McCormick, sitting down and abandoning the enterprise
with the most shameless indifference.</p>

<p>"'Bout the dinner at St. Jo?" asked the person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
addressed&mdash;a gentleman whose faculty of alimentary imagination
had been at once the bliss and torment of his present
social circle.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>They all gathered eagerly around Mr. McCormick; even
Mr. Dumphy, who was still moving away, stopped.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. March, "it began with beefsteak and
injins&mdash;beefsteak, you know, juicy and cut very thick, and
jess squashy with gravy and injins." There was a very perceptible
watering of the mouth in the party, and Mr. March,
with the genius of a true narrator, under the plausible disguise
of having forgotten his story, repeated the last sentence&mdash;"jess
squashy with gravy and injins. And taters&mdash;baked."</p>

<p>"You said fried before!&mdash;and dripping with fat!" interposed
Mrs. Brackett, hastily.</p>

<p>"For them as likes fried&mdash;but baked goes furder&mdash;skins
and all&mdash;and sassage and coffee and flapjacks!"</p>

<p>At this magical word they laughed, not mirthfully perhaps,
but eagerly and expectantly, and said, "Go on!"</p>

<p>"And flapjacks!"</p>

<p>"You said that afore," said Mrs. Brackett, with a burst of
passion. "Go on!" with an oath.</p>

<p>The giver of this Barmecide feast saw his dangerous position,
and looked around for Dumphy, but he had disappeared.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

<h5>WITHIN.</h5>


<p>The hut into which Ashley descended was like a Greenlander's
"iglook," below the surface of the snow. Accident
rather than design had given it this Arctic resemblance. As
snow upon snow had blocked up its entrance, and reared
its white ladders against its walls, and as the strength of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
exhausted inmates slowly declined, communication with the
outward world was kept up only by a single narrow passage.
Excluded from the air, it was close and stifling, but it had a
warmth that perhaps the thin blood of its occupants craved
more than light or ventilation.</p>

<p>A smouldering fire in a wooden chimney threw a faint
flicker on the walls. By its light, lying on the floor, were
discernible four figures&mdash;a young woman and a child of three
or four years wrapped in a single blanket, near the fire;
nearer the door two men, separately enwrapped, lay apart.
They might have been dead, so deep and motionless were
their slumbers.</p>

<p>Perhaps some fear of this filled the mind of Ashley as he
entered, for after a moment's hesitation, without saying a
word, he passed quickly to the side of the young woman,
and, kneeling beside her, placed his hand upon her face.
Slight as was the touch, it awakened her. I know not what
subtle magnetism was in that contact, but she caught the
hand in her own, sat up, and before the eyes were scarcely
opened, uttered the single word&mdash;</p>

<p>"Philip!"</p>

<p>"Grace&mdash;hush!"</p>

<p>He took her hand, kissed it, and pointed warningly toward
the other sleepers.</p>

<p>"Speak low. I have much to say to you."</p>

<p>The young girl seemed to be content to devour the
speaker with her eyes.</p>

<p>"You have come back," she whispered, with a faint smile,
and a look that showed too plainly the predominance of
that fact above all others in her mind. "I dreamt of you,
Philip."</p>

<p>"Dear Grace"&mdash;he kissed her hand again. "Listen to
me, darling! I have come back, but only with the old
story&mdash;no signs of succour, no indications of help from without!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
My belief is, Grace," he added, in a voice so low as
to be audible only to the quick ear to which it was addressed,
"that we have blundered far south of the usual
travelled trail. Nothing but a miracle or a misfortune like
our own would bring another train this way. We are alone
and helpless&mdash;in an unknown region that even the savage
and brute have abandoned. The only aid we can calculate
upon is from within&mdash;from ourselves. What that aid
amounts to," he continued, turning a cynical eye towards
the sleepers, "you know as well as I."</p>

<p>She pressed his hand, apologetically, as if accepting the
reproach herself, but did not speak.</p>

<p>"As a party we have no strength&mdash;no discipline," he
went on. "Since your father died we have had no leader.
I know what you would say, Grace dear," he continued,
answering the mute protest of the girl's hand, "but even if
it were true&mdash;if I were capable of leading them, they would
not take my counsels. Perhaps it is as well. If we kept
together, the greatest peril of our situation would be ever
present&mdash;the peril from <i>ourselves</i>!"</p>

<p>He looked intently at her as he spoke, but she evidently
did not take his meaning. "Grace," he said, desperately,
"when starving men are thrown together, they are capable
of any sacrifice&mdash;of any crime, to keep the miserable life
that they hold so dear just in proportion as it becomes
valueless. You have read in books&mdash;Grace! good God,
what is the matter?"</p>

<p>If she had not read his meaning in books, she might
have read it at that moment in the face that was peering in
at the door&mdash;a face with so much of animal suggestion in its
horrible wistfulness that she needed no further revelation;
a face full of inhuman ferocity and watchful eagerness, and
yet a face familiar in its outlines&mdash;the face of Dumphy!
Even with her danger came the swifter instinct of feminine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
tact and concealment, and without betraying the real cause
of her momentary horror, she dropped her head upon
Philip's shoulder and whispered, "I understand." When
she raised her head again the face was gone.</p>

<p>"Enough, I did not mean to frighten you, Grace, but
only to show you what we must avoid&mdash;what we have still
strength left to avoid. There is but one chance of escape;
you know what it is&mdash;a desperate one, but no more desperate
than this passive waiting for a certain end. I ask you
again&mdash;will you share it with me? When I first spoke I
was less sanguine than now. Since then I have explored
the ground carefully, and studied the trend of these mountains.
It is <i>possible</i>. I say no more."</p>

<p>"But my sister and brother?"</p>

<p>"The child would be a hopeless impediment, even if she
could survive the fatigue and exposure. Your brother must
stay with her; she will need all his remaining strength and
all the hopefulness that keeps him up. No, Grace, we
must go alone. Remember, our safety means theirs. Their
strength will last until we can send relief; while they would
sink in the attempt to reach it with us. I would go alone,
but I cannot bear, dear Grace, to leave you here."</p>

<p>"I should die if you left me," she said, simply.</p>

<p>"I believe you would, Grace," he said as simply.</p>

<p>"But can we not wait? Help may come at any moment&mdash;to-morrow."</p>

<p>"To-morrow will find us weaker. I should not trust
your strength nor my own a day longer."</p>

<p>"But the old man&mdash;the Doctor?"</p>

<p>"He will soon be beyond the reach of help," said the
young man, sadly. "Hush, he is moving."</p>

<p>One of the blanketed figures had rolled over. Philip
walked to the fire, threw on a fresh stick, and stirred the
embers. The upspringing flash showed the face of an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
man whose eyes were fixed with feverish intensity upon
him.</p>

<p>"What are you doing with the fire?" he asked querulously,
with a slight foreign accent.</p>

<p>"Stirring it!"</p>

<p>"Leave it alone!"</p>

<p>Philip listlessly turned away.</p>

<p>"Come here," said the old man.</p>

<p>Philip approached.</p>

<p>"You need say nothing," said the old man after a pause,
in which he examined Philip's face keenly. "I read your
news in your face&mdash;the old story&mdash;I know it by heart."</p>

<p>"Well?" said Philip.</p>

<p>"Well!" said the old man, stolidly.</p>

<p>Philip again turned away.</p>

<p>"You buried the case and papers?" asked the old man.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Through the snow&mdash;in the earth?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Securely?"</p>

<p>"Securely."</p>

<p>"How do you indicate it?"</p>

<p>"By a cairn of stones."</p>

<p>"And the notices&mdash;in German and French?"</p>

<p>"I nailed them up wherever I could, near the old trail."</p>

<p>"Good."</p>

<p>The cynical look on Philip's face deepened as he once
more turned away. But before he reached the door he
paused, and drawing from his breast a faded flower, with a
few limp leaves, handed it to the old man.</p>

<p>"I found the duplicate of the plant you were looking for."</p>

<p>The old man half rose on his elbow, breathless with
excitement as he clutched and eagerly examined the plant.</p>

<p>"It is the same," he said, with a sigh of relief, "and yet
you said there was no news!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>"May I ask what it means?" said Philip, with a slight
smile.</p>

<p>"It means that I am right, and Linnæus, Darwin, and
Eschscholtz are wrong. It means a discovery. It means
that this which you call an Alpine flower is not one, but a
new species."</p>

<p>"An important fact to starving men," said Philip, bitterly.</p>

<p>"It means more," continued the old man, without heeding
Philip's tone. "It means that this flower is not developed
in perpetual snow. It means that it is first germinated
in a warm soil and under a kindly sun. It means that if
you had not plucked it, it would have fulfilled its destiny
under those conditions. It means that in two months grass
will be springing where you found it&mdash;even where we now
lie. We are below the limit of perpetual snow."</p>

<p>"In two months!" said the young girl, eagerly, clasping
her hands.</p>

<p>"In two months," said the young man, bitterly. "In two
months we shall be far from here, or dead."</p>

<p>"Probably!" said the old man, coolly; "but if you have
fulfilled my injunctions in regard to my papers and the
collection, they will in good time be discovered and saved."</p>

<p>Ashley turned away with an impatient gesture, and the old
man's head again sank exhaustedly upon his arm. Under
the pretext of caressing the child, Ashley crossed over to
Grace, uttered a few hurried and almost inaudible words,
and disappeared through the door. When he had gone,
the old man raised his head again and called feebly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Grace!"</p>

<p>"Dr. Devarges!"</p>

<p>"Come here!"</p>

<p>She rose and crossed over to his side.</p>

<p>"Why did he stir the fire, Grace?" said Devarges, with a
suspicious glance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"You tell him everything&mdash;did you tell him that?"</p>

<p>"I did not, sir."</p>

<p>Devarges looked as if he would read the inmost thoughts
of the girl, and then, as if reassured, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Take it from the fire, and let it cool in the snow."</p>

<p>The young girl raked away the embers of the dying fire,
and disclosed what seemed to be a stone of the size of a
hen's egg incandescent and glowing. With the aid of two
half-burnt slicks she managed to extract it, and deposited
it in a convenient snow-drift near the door, and then
returned to the side of the old man.</p>

<p>"Grace!"</p>

<p>"Sir!"</p>

<p>"You are going away!"</p>

<p>Grace did not speak.</p>

<p>"Don't deny it. I overheard you. Perhaps it is the
best that you can do. But whether it is or not you will do
it&mdash;of course. Grace, what do you know of that man?"</p>

<p>Neither the contact of daily familiarity, the quality of
suffering, nor the presence of approaching death, could subdue
the woman's nature in Grace. She instantly raised her
shield. From behind it she began to fence feebly with the
dying man.</p>

<p>"Why, what we all know of him, sir&mdash;a true friend; a
man to whose courage, intellect, and endurance we owe so
much. And so unselfish, sir!"</p>

<p>"Humph!&mdash;what else?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;except that he has always been your devoted
friend&mdash;and I thought you were his. You brought him to
us," she said a little viciously.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I picked him up at Sweetwater. But what do you
know of his history? What has he told you?"</p>

<p>"He ran away from a wicked stepfather and relations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
whom he hated. He came out West to live alone&mdash;among
the Indians&mdash;or to seek his fortune in Oregon. He is very
proud&mdash;you know, sir. He is as unlike us as you are, sir,&mdash;he
is a gentleman. He is educated."</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe that's what they call it here, and he
doesn't know the petals of a flower from the stamens,"
muttered Devarges. "Well! After you run away with
him does he propose to marry you?"</p>

<p>For an instant a faint flush deepened the wan cheek of
the girl, and she lost her guard. But the next moment she
recovered it.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," said this arch hypocrite, sweetly, "how can
you jest so cruelly at such a moment? The life of my dear
brother and sister, the lives of the poor women in yonder
hut, depend upon our going. He and I are the only ones
left who have strength enough to make the trial. I can
assist him, for, although strong, I require less to support
my strength than he. Something tells me we shall be
successful; we shall return soon with help. Oh, sir,&mdash;it is
no time for trifling now; our lives&mdash;even your own is at
stake!"</p>

<p>"My own life," said the old man, impassively, "is already
spent. Before you return, if you return at all, I shall
be beyond your help."</p>

<p>A spasm of pain appeared to pass over his face. He lay
still for a moment as if to concentrate his strength for a
further effort. But when he again spoke his voice was
much lower, and he seemed to articulate with difficulty.</p>

<p>"Grace," he said at last, "come nearer, girl,&mdash;I have
something to tell you."</p>

<p>Grace hesitated. Within the last few moments a shy,
nervous dread of the man which she could not account for
had taken possession of her. She looked toward her sleeping
brother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>"He will not waken," said Devarges, following the direction
of her eyes. "The anodyne still holds its effect.
Bring me what you took from the fire."</p>

<p>Grace brought the stone&mdash;a dull bluish-grey slag. The
old man took it, examined it, and then said to Grace&mdash;</p>

<p>"Rub it briskly on your blanket."</p>

<p>Grace did so. After a few moments it began to exhibit
a faint white lustre on its polished surface.</p>

<p>"It looks like silver," said Grace, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> silver!" replied Devarges.</p>

<p>Grace put it down quickly and moved slightly away.</p>

<p>"Take it," said the old man,&mdash;"it is yours. A year ago
I found it in a ledge of the mountain range far west of this.
I know where it lies in bulk&mdash;a fortune, Grace, do you
hear?&mdash;hidden in the bluish stone you put in the fire for
me last night. I can tell you where and how to find it. I
can give you the title to it&mdash;the right of discovery. Take
it&mdash;it is yours."</p>

<p>"No, no," said the girl, hurriedly, "keep it yourself.
You will live to enjoy it."</p>

<p>"Never, Grace! even were I to live I should not make
use of it. I have in my life had more than my share of it,
and it brought me no happiness. It has no value to me&mdash;the
rankest weed that grows above it is worth more in my
eyes. Take it. To the world it means everything&mdash;wealth
and position. Take it. It will make you as proud and
independent as your lover&mdash;it will make you always gracious
in his eyes;&mdash;it will be a setting to your beauty,&mdash;it will be
a pedestal to your virtue. Take it&mdash;it is yours."</p>

<p>"But you have relatives&mdash;friends," said the girl, drawing
away from the shining stone with a half superstitious awe.
"There are others whose claims"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"None greater than yours," interrupted the old man, with
the nervous haste of failing breath. "Call it a reward if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
you choose. Look upon it as a bribe to keep your lover
to the fulfilment of his promise to preserve my manuscripts
and collection. Think, if you like, that it is an act of
retribution&mdash;that once in my life I might have known a
young girl whose future would have been blessed by such a
gift. Think&mdash;think what you like&mdash;but take it!"</p>

<p>His voice had sunk to a whisper. A greyish pallor had
overspread his face, and his breath came with difficulty.
Grace would have called her brother, but with a motion of
his hand Devarges restrained her. With a desperate effort
he raised himself upon his elbow, and drawing an envelope
from his pocket, put it in her hand.</p>

<p>"It contains&mdash;map&mdash;description of mine and locality&mdash;yours&mdash;say
you will take it&mdash;Grace, quick, say"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>His head had again sunk to the floor. She stooped to
raise it. As she did so a slight shadow darkened the opening
by the door. She raised her eyes quickly and saw the
face of Dumphy!</p>

<p>She did not shrink this time; but, with a sudden
instinct, she turned to Devarges, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will!"</p>

<p>She raised her eyes again defiantly, but the face had disappeared.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the old man. His lips moved again,
but without a sound. A strange film had begun to gather
in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Dr. Devarges," whispered Grace.</p>

<p>He did not speak. "He is dying," thought the young
girl as a new and sudden fear overcame her. She rose
quickly and crossed hurriedly to her brother and shook him.
A prolonged inspiration, like a moan, was the only response.
For a moment she glanced wildly around the room and then
ran to the door.</p>

<p>"Philip!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no response. She climbed up through the
tunnel-like opening. It was already quite dark, and a few
feet beyond the hut nothing was distinguishable. She cast
a rapid backward glance, and then, with a sudden desperation,
darted forward into the darkness. At the same moment
two figures raised themselves from behind the shadow of the
mound and slipped down the tunnel into the hut&mdash;Mrs.
Brackett and Mr. Dumphy. They might have been the
meanest predatory animals&mdash;so stealthy, so eager, so timorous,
so crouching, and yet so agile were their motions. They
ran sometimes upright, and sometimes on all fours, hither and
thither. They fell over each other in their eagerness, and
struck and spat savagely at each other in the half darkness.
They peered into corners, they rooted in the dying embers
and among the ashes, they groped among the skins and
blankets, they smelt and sniffed at every article. They paused
at last apparently unsuccessful, and glared at each other.</p>

<p>"They must have eaten it," said Mrs. Brackett, in a
hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>"It didn't look like suthin' to eat," said Dumphy.</p>

<p>"You saw 'em take it from the fire?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"And rub it?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"Fool. Don't you see"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"It was a baked potato."</p>

<p>Dumphy sat dumfounded.</p>

<p>"Why should they rub it? It takes off the cracklin' skins,"
he said.</p>

<p>"They've got such fine stomachs!" answered Mrs.
Bracket, with an oath.</p>

<p>Dumphy was still aghast with the importance of his discovery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"He said he knew where there was more!" he whispered
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"I didn't get to hear."</p>

<p>"Fool! Why didn't ye rush in and grip his throat until
he told yer?" hissed Mrs. Brackett, in a tempest of baffled
rage and disappointment. "Ye ain't got the spunk of a flea.
Let me get hold of that gal&mdash;Hush! what's that?"</p>

<p>"He's moving!" said Dumphy.</p>

<p>In an instant they had both changed again into slinking,
crouching, baffled animals, eager only for escape. Yet they
dared not move.</p>

<p>The old man had turned over, and his lips were moving
in the mutterings of delirium. Presently he called
"Grace!"</p>

<p>With a sign of caution to her companion, the woman
leaned over him.</p>

<p>"Yes, deary, I'm here."</p>

<p>"Tell him not to forget. Make him keep his promise.
Ask him where it is buried!"</p>

<p>"Yes, deary!"</p>

<p>"He'll tell you. He knows!"</p>

<p>"Yes, deary!"</p>

<p>"At the head of Monument Cañon. A hundred feet
north of the lone pine. Dig two feet down below the surface
of the cairn."</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"Where the wolves can't get it."</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"The stones keep it from ravenous beasts."</p>

<p>"Yes, in course."</p>

<p>"That might tear it up."</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"Starving beasts!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, deary!"</p>

<p>The fire of his wandering eyes went out suddenly, like a
candle; his jaw dropped; he was dead. And over him
the man and woman crouched in fearful joy, looking at
each other with the first smile that had been upon their lips
since they had entered the fateful cañon.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

<h5>GABRIEL.</h5>


<p>It was found the next morning that the party was diminished
by five. Philip Ashley and Grace Conroy, Peter
Dumphy and Mrs. Brackett, were missing; Dr. Paul Devarges
was dead. The death of the old man caused but little
excitement and no sorrow; the absconding of the others
was attributed to some information which they had selfishly
withheld from the remaining ones, and produced a spasm of
impotent rage. In five minutes their fury knew no bounds.
The lives and property of the fugitives were instantly declared
forfeit. Steps were taken&mdash;about twenty, I think&mdash;in
the direction of their flight, but finally abandoned.</p>

<p>Only one person knew that Philip and Grace had gone
together&mdash;Gabriel Conroy. On awakening early that morning
he had found pinned to his blanket a paper with these
words in pencil&mdash;</p>

<p>"God bless dear brother and sister, and keep them until
Philip and I come back with help."</p>

<p>With it were a few scraps of provisions, evidently saved
by Grace from her scant rations, and left as a parting gift.
These Gabriel instantly turned into the common stock.
Then he began to comfort the child. Added to his natural
hopefulness, he had a sympathetic instinct with the pains
and penalties of childhood, not so much a quality of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
intellect as of his nature. He had all the physical adaptabilities
of a nurse&mdash;a large, tender touch, a low persuasive
voice, pliant yet unhesitating limbs, and broad, well-cushioned
surfaces. During the weary journey women had
instinctively entrusted babies to his charge; most of the
dead had died in his arms; all forms and conditions of
helplessness had availed themselves of his easy capacity.
No one thought of thanking him. I do not think he ever
expected it; he always appeared morally irresponsible and
quite unconscious of his own importance, and, as is frequent
in such cases, there was a tendency to accept his services at
his own valuation. Nay more, there was a slight consciousness
of superiority in those who thus gave him an opportunity
of exhibiting his special faculty.</p>

<p>"Olly," he said, after an airy preliminary toss, "would
ye like to have a nice dolly?"</p>

<p>Olly opened her wide hungry eyes in hopeful anticipation
and nodded assent.</p>

<p>"A nice dolly, with real mamma," he continued, "who
plays with it like a true baby. Would ye like to help her
play with it?"</p>

<p>The idea of a joint partnership of this kind evidently
pleased Olly by its novelty.</p>

<p>"Well then, brother Gabe will get you one. But Gracie
will have to go away, so that the doll's mamma kin come."</p>

<p>Olly at first resented this, but eventually succumbed to
novelty, after the fashion of her sex, starving or otherwise.
Yet she prudently asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is it ever hungry?"</p>

<p>"It is never hungry," replied Gabriel, confidently.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Olly, with an air of relief.</p>

<p>Then Gabriel, the cunning, sought Mrs. Dumphy, the
mentally alienated.</p>

<p>"You are jest killin' of yourself with the tendin' o' that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
child," he said, after bestowing a caress on the blanket and
slightly pinching an imaginary cheek of the effigy. "It
would be likelier and stronger fur a playmate. Good
gracious! how thin it is gettin'. A change will do it good;
fetch it to Olly, and let her help you to tend it until&mdash;until&mdash;to-morrow."
To-morrow was the extreme limit of Mrs.
Dumphy's future.</p>

<p>So Mrs. Dumphy and her effigy were installed in Gracie's
place, and Olly was made happy. A finer nature or a more
active imagination than Gabriel's would have revolted at
this monstrous combination; but Gabriel only saw that they
appeared contented, and the first pressing difficulty of
Gracie's absence was overcome. So alternately they took
care of the effigy, the child simulating the cares of the future
and losing the present in them, the mother living in the
memories of the past. Perhaps it might have been pathetic
to have seen Olly and Mrs. Dumphy both saving the infinitesimal
remnants of their provisions for the doll, but the
only spectator was one of the actors, Gabriel, who lent himself
to the deception; and pathos, to be effective, must be
viewed from the outside.</p>

<p>At noon that day the hysterical young man, Gabriel's
cousin, died. Gabriel went over to the other hut and
endeavoured to cheer the survivors. He succeeded in
infecting them so far with his hopefulness as to loosen the
tongue and imagination of the story-teller, but at four o'clock
the body had not yet been buried. It was evening, and the
three were sitting over the embers, when a singular change
came over Mrs. Dumphy. The effigy suddenly slipped from
her hands, and looking up, Gabriel perceived that her arms
had dropped to her side, and that her eyes were fixed on
vacancy. He spoke to her, but she made no sign nor
response of any kind. He touched her and found her limbs
rigid and motionless. Olly began to cry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>The sound seemed to agitate Mrs. Dumphy. Without
moving a limb, she said, in a changed, unnatural voice,
"Hark!"</p>

<p>Olly choked her sobs at a sign from Gabriel.</p>

<p>"They're coming!" said Mrs. Dumphy.</p>

<p>"Which?" said Gabriel.</p>

<p>"The relief party."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Far, far away. They're jest setting out. I see 'em&mdash;a
dozen men with pack horses and provisions. The leader is
an American&mdash;the others are strangers. They're coming&mdash;but
far, oh, so far away!"</p>

<p>Gabriel fixed his eyes upon her, but did not speak. After
a death-like pause, she went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"The sun is shining, the birds are singing, the grass is
springing where they ride&mdash;but, oh, so far&mdash;too far away!"</p>

<p>"Do you know them?" asked Gabriel.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Do they know us?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why do they come, and how do they know where we
are?" asked Gabriel.</p>

<p>"Their leader has seen us."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"In a dream."<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Gabriel whistled and looked at the rag baby. He was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>willing to recognise something abnormal, and perhaps even
prophetic, in this insane woman; but a coincident exaltation
in a stranger who was not suffering from the illusions
produced by starvation was beyond his credulity. Nevertheless,
the instincts of good humour and hopefulness were
stronger, and he presently asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"How will they come?"</p>

<p>"Up through a beautiful valley and a broad shining river.
Then they will cross a mountain until they come to another
beautiful valley with steep sides, and a rushing river that
runs so near us that I can almost hear it now. Don't you
see it? It is just beyond the snow peak there; a green
valley, with the rain falling upon it. Look! it is there."</p>

<p>She pointed directly north, toward the region of inhospitable
snow.</p>

<p>"Could you get to it?" asked the practical Gabriel.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I must wait here for my baby. She is coming for us.
She will find me here."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow."</p>

<p>It was the last time that she uttered that well-worn
sentence; for it was only a little past midnight that her
baby came to her&mdash;came to her with a sudden light, that
might have been invisible to Gabriel, but that it was
reflected in her own lack-lustre eyes&mdash;came to this poor
half-witted creature with such distinctness that she half rose,
stretched out her thin yearning arms, and received it&mdash;a
corpse! Gabriel placed the effigy in her arms and folded
them over it. Then he ran swiftly to the other hut. For
some unexplained reason he did not get further than the
door. What he saw there he has never told; but when he
groped his fainting way back to his own hut again, his face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
was white and bloodless, and his eyes wild and staring.
Only one impulse remained&mdash;to fly for ever from the cursed
spot. He stopped only long enough to snatch up the
sobbing and frightened Olly, and then, with a loud cry to
God to help him&mdash;to help <i>them</i>&mdash;he dashed out, and was
lost in the darkness.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>

<h5>NATURE SHOWS THEM THE WAY.</h5>


<p>It was a spur of the long grave-like ridge that lay to the
north of the cañon. Up its gaunt white flank two figures
had been slowly crawling since noon, until at sunset they at
last stood upon its outer verge outlined against the sky&mdash;Philip
and Grace.</p>

<p>For all the fatigues of the journey, the want of nourishing
food and the haunting shadow of the suffering she had
left, the face of Grace, flushed with the dying sun, was very
pretty. The boy's dress she had borrowed was ill-fitting,
and made her exquisite little figure still more diminutive, but
it could not entirely hide its graceful curves. Here in this
rosy light the swooning fringes of her dark eyes were no
longer hidden; the perfect oval of her face, even the few
freckles on her short upper lip, were visible to Philip. Partly
as a physical support, partly to reassure her, he put his arm
tenderly around her waist. Then he kissed her. It is
possible that this last act was purely gratuitous.</p>

<p>Howbeit Grace first asked, with the characteristic prudence
of her sex, the question she had already asked
many days before that day, "Do you love me, Philip?"
And Philip, with the ready frankness of our sex on such
occasions, had invariably replied, "I do."</p>

<p>Nevertheless the young man was pre-occupied, anxious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
and hungry. It was the fourth day since they had left the
hut. On the second day they had found some pine cones
with the nuts still intact and fresh beneath the snow, and
later a squirrel's hoard. On the third day Philip had killed
the proprietor and eaten him. The same evening Philip
had espied a duck winging his way up the cañon. Philip,
strong in the belief that some inland lake was the immediate
object of its flight, had first marked its course, and then
brought it down with a long shot. Then having altered
their course in accordance with it suggestion, they ate their
guide next morning for breakfast.</p>

<p>Philip was also disappointed. The summit of the spur
so laboriously attained only showed him the same endless
succession of white snow billows stretching rigidly to the
horizon's edge. There was no break&mdash;no glimpse of watercourse
or lake. There was nothing to indicate whence the
bird had come or the probable point it was endeavouring to
reach. He was beginning to consider the feasibility of
again changing their course, when an unlooked-for accident
took that volition from his hands.</p>

<p>Grace had ventured out to the extreme limit of the rocky
cliff, and with straining eyes was trying to peer beyond the
snow fields, when the treacherous ledge on which she was
standing began to give way. In an instant Philip was at
her side and had caught her hand, but at the same moment
a large rock of the ledge dropped from beneath her feet,
and left her with no support but his grasp. The sudden
shock loosened also the insecure granite on which Philip
stood. Before he could gain secure foothold it also
trembled, tottered, slipped, and then fell, carrying Philip
and Grace with it. Luckily this immense mass of stone
and ice got fairly away before them, and ploughed down the
steep bank of the cliff, breaking off the projecting rocks
and protuberances, and cutting a clean, though almost perpendicular,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
path down the mountain side. Even in falling
Philip had presence of mind enough to forbear clutching at
the crumbling ledge, and so precipitating the rock that
might crush them. Before he lost his senses he remembered
tightening his grip of Grace's arm, and drawing her
face and head forward to his breast, and even in his unconsciousness
it seemed that he instinctively guided her into
the smooth passage or "shoot" made by the plunging rock
below them; and even then he was half conscious of dashing
into sudden material darkness and out again into light,
and of the crashing and crackling of branches around him,
and even the brushing of the stiff pine needles against his
face and limbs. Then he felt himself stopped, and then,
and then only, everything whirled confusedly by him, and
his brain seemed to partake of the motion, and then&mdash;the
relief of utter blankness and oblivion. When he regained
his senses, it was with a burning heat in his throat, and the
sensation of strangling. When he opened his eyes he saw
Grace bending over him, pale and anxious, and chafing his
hands and temples with snow. There was a spot of blood
upon her round cheek.</p>

<p>"You are hurt, Grace!" were the first words that Philip
gasped.</p>

<p>"No!&mdash;dear, brave Philip&mdash;but only so thankful and
happy for your escape." Yet, at the same moment the
colour faded from her cheek, and even the sun-kissed line
of her upper lip grew bloodless, as she leaned back against
a tree.</p>

<p>But Philip did not see her. His eyes were rapidly taking
in his strange surroundings. He was lying among the
broken fragments of pine branches and the débris of the
cliff above. In his ears was the sound of hurrying water,
and before him, scarce a hundred feet, a rushing river!
He looked up; the red glow of sunset was streaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
through the broken limbs and shattered branches of the
snow-thatched roof that he had broken through in his descent.
Here and there along the river the same light was
penetrating the interstices and openings of this strange vault
that arched above this sunless stream.</p>

<p>He knew now whence the duck had flown! He knew
now why he had not seen the watercourse before! He
knew now where the birds and beasts had betaken themselves&mdash;why
the woods and cañons were trackless! Here
was at last the open road! He staggered to his feet with a
cry of delight.</p>

<p>"Grace, we are saved."</p>

<p>Grace looked at him with eyes that perhaps spoke more
eloquently of joy at his recovery than of comprehension of
his delight.</p>

<p>"Look, Grace! this is Nature's own road&mdash;only a lane,
perhaps&mdash;but a clue to our way out of this wilderness. As
we descend the stream it will open into a broader valley."</p>

<p>"I know it," she said, simply.</p>

<p>Philip looked at her inquiringly.</p>

<p>"When I dragged you out of the way of the falling rocks
and snow above, I had a glimpse of the valley you speak
of. I saw it from there."</p>

<p>She pointed to a ledge of rock above the opening where
the great stone that had fallen had lodged.</p>

<p>"When you dragged me, my child?"</p>

<p>Grace smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"You don't know how strong I am," she said, and then
proved it by fainting dead away.</p>

<p>Philip started to his feet and ran to her side. Then he
felt for the precious flask that he had preserved so sacredly
through all their hardships, but it was gone. He glanced
around him; it was lying on the snow, empty! For the
first time in their weary pilgrimage Philip uttered a groan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
At the sound Grace opened her sweet eyes. She saw her
lover with the empty flask in his hand, and smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"I poured it all down your throat, dear," she said.
"You looked so faint&mdash;I thought you were dying&mdash;forgive
me!"</p>

<p>"But I was only stunned; and you, Grace, you"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Am better now," she said, as she strove to rise. But
she uttered a weak little cry and fell back again.</p>

<p>Philip did not hear her. He was already climbing the
ledge she had spoken of. When he returned his face was
joyous.</p>

<p>"I see it, Grace; it is only a few miles away. It is still
light, and we shall camp there to-night."</p>

<p>"I am afraid&mdash;not&mdash;dear Philip," said Grace, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Philip, a little impatiently.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;I&mdash;think&mdash;my leg is broken!"</p>

<p>"Grace!"</p>

<p>But she had fainted.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER V.</h4>

<h5>OUT OF THE WOODS&mdash;INTO THE SHADOW.</h5>


<p>Happily Grace was wrong. Her ankle was severely
sprained, and she could not stand. Philip tore up his
shirt, and, with bandages dipped in snow water, wrapped
up the swollen limb. Then he knocked over a quail in the
bushes and another duck, and clearing away the brush
for a camping spot, built a fire, and tempted the young girl
with a hot supper. The peril of starvation passed, their
greatest danger was over&mdash;a few days longer of enforced
rest and inactivity was the worst to be feared.</p>

<p>The air had grown singularly milder with the last few
hours. At midnight a damp breeze stirred the pine needles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
above their heads, and an ominous muffled beating was
heard upon the snow-packed vault. It was rain.</p>

<p>"It is the reveille of spring!" whispered Philip.</p>

<p>But Grace was in no mood for poetry&mdash;even a lover's.
She let her head drop upon his shoulder, and then
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You must go on, dear, and leave me here."</p>

<p>"Grace!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Philip! I can live till you come back. I fear no
danger now. I am so much better off than <i>they</i> are!"</p>

<p>A few tears dropped on his hand. Philip winced. Perhaps
it was his conscience; perhaps there was something in the
girl's tone, perhaps because she had once before spoken in
the same way, but it jarred upon a certain quality in his nature
which he was pleased to call his "common sense." Philip
really believed himself a high-souled, thoughtless, ardent, impetuous
temperament, saved only from destruction by the
occasional dominance of this quality.</p>

<p>For a moment he did not speak. He thought how, at the
risk of his own safety, he had snatched this girl from terrible
death; he thought how he had guarded her through their
perilous journey, taking all the burdens upon himself; he
thought how happy he had made her&mdash;how she had even
admitted her happiness to him; he thought of her present
helplessness, and how willing he was to delay the journey
on her account; he dwelt even upon a certain mysterious,
ill-defined but blissful future with him to which he was
taking her; and yet here, at the moment of their possible
deliverance, she was fretting about two dying people, who,
without miraculous interference, would be dead before she
could reach them. It was part of Philip's equitable self-examination&mdash;a
fact of which he was very proud&mdash;that he always
put himself in the position of the person with whom he differed,
and imagined how <i>he</i> would act under the like circumstances.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Perhaps it is hardly necessary to say that Philip
always found that his conduct under those conditions would
be totally different. In the present instance, putting himself
in Grace's position, he felt that he would have abandoned
all and everything for a love and future like hers. That
she did not was evidence of a moral deficiency or a blood
taint. Logic of this kind is easy and irrefutable. It has
been known to obtain even beyond the Sierras, and with
people who were not physically exhausted. After a pause
he said to Grace, in a changed voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let us talk plainly for a few moments, Grace, and understand
each other before we go forward or backward. It is
five days since we left the hut; were we even certain of
finding our wandering way back again, we could not reach
them before another five days had elapsed; by that time
all will be over. They have either been saved or are beyond
the reach of help. This sounds harsh, Grace, but it is no
harsher than the fact. Had we stayed, we would, without
helping them, have only shared their fate. I might have been
in your brother's place, you in your sister's. It is our fortune,
not our fault, that we are not dying with them. It has been
willed that you and I should be saved. It might have been
willed that we should have perished in our attempts to succour
them, and that relief which came to <i>them</i> would have
never reached <i>us</i>."</p>

<p>Grace was no logician, and could not help thinking that
if Philip had said this before, she would not have left the
hut. But the masculine reader will, I trust, at once detect
the irrelevance of the feminine suggestion, and observe that
it did not refute Philip's argument. She looked at him
with a half frightened air. Perhaps it was the tears that
dimmed her eyes, but his few words seemed to have removed
him to a great distance, and for the first time a strange sense
of loneliness came over her. She longed to reach her yearning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
arms to him again, but with this feeling came a sense
of shame that she had not felt before.</p>

<p>Philip noticed her hesitation, and half interpreted it. He
let her passive head fall.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we had better wait until we are ourselves out
of danger before we talk of helping others," he said with
something of his old bitterness. "This accident may keep
us here some days, and we know not as yet where we are.
Go to sleep now," he said more kindly, "and in the morning
we will see what can be done."</p>

<p>Grace sobbed herself to sleep! Poor, poor Grace! She
had been looking for this opportunity of speaking about
herself&mdash;about their future. This was to have been the
beginning of her confidence about Dr. Devarges's secret;
she would have told him frankly all the doctor had said,
even his suspicions of Philip himself. And then Philip
would have been sure to have told her his plans, and they
would have gone back with help, and Philip would have
been a hero whom Gabriel would have instantly recognised
as the proper husband for Grace, and they would have all
been very happy. And now they were all dead, and had
died, perhaps, cursing her, and&mdash;Philip&mdash;Philip had not
kissed her good-night, and was sitting gloomily under a tree!</p>

<p>The dim light of a leaden morning broke through the
snow vault above their heads. It was raining heavily, the
river had risen, and was still rising. It was filled with
drift and branches, and snow and ice, the waste and ware
of many a mile. Occasionally a large uprooted tree with a
gaunt forked root like a mast sailed by. Suddenly Philip,
who had been sitting with his chin upon his hands, rose
with a shout. Grace looked up languidly. He pointed to
a tree that, floating by, had struck the bank where they sat,
and then drifted broadside against it, where for a moment
it lay motionless.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Grace," he said, with his old spirits, "Nature has taken
us in hand herself. If we are to be saved, it is by her
methods. She brought us here to the water's edge, and
now she sends a boat to take us off again. Come!"</p>

<p>Before Grace could reply, Philip had lifted her gaily in
his arms, and deposited her between two upright roots of
the tree. Then he placed beside her his rifle and provisions,
and leaping himself on the bow of this strange craft,
shoved it off with a broken branch that he had found. For
a moment it still clung to the bank, and then suddenly
catching the impulse of the current, darted away like a
living creature.</p>

<p>The river was very narrow and rapid where they had
embarked, and for a few moments it took all of Philip's
energy and undivided attention to keep the tree in the
centre of the current. Grace sat silent, admiring her lover,
alert, forceful, and glowing with excitement. Presently
Philip called to her&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you see that log? We are near a settlement."</p>

<p>A freshly-hewn log of pine was floating in the current
beside them. A ray of hope shot through Grace's sad
fancies; if they were so near help, might not it have already
reached the sufferers? But she forbore to speak to Philip
again upon that subject, and in his new occupation he
seemed to have forgotten her. It was with a little thrill of
joy that at last she saw him turn, and balancing himself with
his bough upon their crank craft, walk down slowly toward
her. When he reached her side he sat down, and, taking
her hand in his, for the first time since the previous night,
he said gently&mdash;</p>

<p>"Grace, my child, I have something to tell you."</p>

<p>Grace's little heart throbbed quickly; for a moment she
did not dare to lift her long lashes toward his. Without
noticing her embarrassment he went on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"In a few hours we shall be no longer in the wilderness,
but in the world again&mdash;in a settlement perhaps, among
men and&mdash;perhaps women. Strangers certainly&mdash;not the
relatives you have known, and who know you&mdash;not the
people with whom we have been familiar for so many weeks
and days&mdash;but people who know nothing of us, or our
sufferings."</p>

<p>Grace looked at him, but did not speak.</p>

<p>"You understand, Grace, that, not knowing this, they
might put their own construction upon our flight.</p>

<p>"To speak plainly, my child, you are a young woman, and
I am a young man. Your beauty, dear Grace, offers an explanation
of our companionship that the world will accept
more readily than any other, and the truth to many would
seem scarcely as natural. For this reason it must not be
told. I will go back alone with relief, and leave you here
in some safe hands until I return. But I leave you here
not as Grace Conroy&mdash;you shall take my own name!"</p>

<p>A hot flush mounted to Grace's throat and cheek, and
for an instant, with parted lips, she hung breathless upon
his next word. He continued quietly&mdash;</p>

<p>"You shall be my sister&mdash;Grace Ashley."</p>

<p>The blood fell from her cheek, her eyelids dropped, and
she buried her face in her hands. Philip waited patiently
for her reply. When she lifted her face again, it was quiet
and calm&mdash;there was even a slight flush of proud colour in
her cheek as she met his gaze, and with the faintest curl of
her upper lip said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are right!"</p>

<p>At the same moment there was a sudden breaking of light
and warmth and sunshine over their heads; the tree swiftly
swung round a sharp curve in the river, and then drifted
slowly into a broad, overflowed valley, sparkling with the
emerald of gently sloping hillsides, and dazzling with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
glow of the noonday sun. And beyond, from a cluster of
willows scarcely a mile away, the smoke of a cabin chimney
curled in the still air.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER VI.</h4>

<h5>FOOTPRINTS.</h5>


<p>For two weeks an unclouded sun rose and set on the rigid
outlines of Monument Point. For two weeks there had been
no apparent change in the ghastly whiteness of the snow-flanked
rocks; in the white billows that rose rank on rank
beyond, in the deathlike stillness that reigned above and
below. It was the first day of April; there was the mildness
of early spring in the air that blew over this gaunt waste,
and yet awoke no sound or motion. And yet a nearer approach
showed that a slow insidious change had been taking
place. The white flanks of the mountain were more hollow;
the snow had shrunk visibly away in places, leaving
the grey rocks naked and protuberant; the rigid outlines
were there, but less full and rounded; the skeleton was
beginning to show through the wasting flesh; there were
great patches of snow that had sloughed away, leaving the
gleaming granite bare below. It was the last change of the
Hippocratic face that Nature turned toward the spectator.
And yet this change had been noiseless&mdash;the solitude
unbroken.</p>

<p>And then one day there suddenly drifted across the
deathlike valley the chime of jingling spurs and the sound
of human voices. Down the long defile a cavalcade of
mounted men and pack mules made their way, plunging
through drifts and clattering over rocks. The unwonted
sound awoke the long slumbering echoes of the mountain,
brought down small avalanches from cliff and tree, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
last brought from some cavern of the rocks to the surface of
the snow a figure so wild, haggard, dishevelled, and monstrous,
that it was scarcely human. It crawled upon the
snow, dodging behind rocks with the timidity of a frightened
animal, and at last, squatting behind a tree, awaited in ambush
the approach of the party.</p>

<p>Two men rode ahead; one grave, preoccupied, and
reticent. The other alert, active, and voluble. At last the
reticent man spoke, but slowly, and as if recalling a memory
rather than recording a present impression.</p>

<p>"They cannot be far away from us now. It was in
some such spot that I first saw them. The place is
familiar."</p>

<p>"Heaven send that it may be!" said the other hastily,
"for to tell you the truth, I doubt if we will be able to keep
the men together a day longer in this crazy quest, unless we
discover something."</p>

<p>"It was here," continued the other dreamily, not heeding
his companion, "that I saw the figures of a man and woman.
If there is not a cairn of stone somewhere about this spot, I
shall believe my dream false, and confess myself an old
fool."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;as I said before," rejoined the other, laughing,
"anything&mdash;a scrap of paper, an old blanket, or a broken
waggon-tongue will do. Columbus helped his course and
kept up his crew on a fragment of seaweed. But what are
the men looking at? Great God! There <i>is</i> something
moving by yonder rock!"</p>

<p>By one common superstitious instinct the whole party
had crowded together&mdash;those who, a few moments before,
had been loudest in their scepticism, held their breath with
awe, and trembled with excitement&mdash;as the shambling
figure that had watched them enter the cañon rose from its
lair, and taking upon itself a human semblance, with uncouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
gestures and a strange hoarse cry made towards them.
It was Dumphy!</p>

<p>The leader was the first to recover himself. He advanced
from the rest and met Dumphy half-way.</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"A man."</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Starving."</p>

<p>"Where are the others?"</p>

<p>Dumphy cast a suspicious glance at him and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"The others. You are not alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am!"</p>

<p>"How did you get here?"</p>

<p>"What's that to you? I'm here and starving. Gimme
suthin' to eat and drink."</p>

<p>He sank exhaustedly on all fours again.</p>

<p>There was a murmur of sympathy from the men.</p>

<p>"Give him suthin'. Don't you see he can't stand&mdash;much
less talk? Where's the doctor?"</p>

<p>And then the younger of the leaders thus adjured&mdash;"Leave
him to me&mdash;he wants my help just now more
than yours."</p>

<p>He poured some brandy down his throat. Dumphy
gasped, and then staggered to his feet.</p>

<p>"What did you say your name was?" asked the young
surgeon kindly.</p>

<p>"Jackson," said Dumphy, with a defiantly blank look.</p>

<p>"Where from?"</p>

<p>"Missouri."</p>

<p>"How did you get here?"</p>

<p>"Strayed from my party."</p>

<p>"And they are&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gone on. Gimme suthin' to eat!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Take him back to camp and hand him over to Sanchez.
He'll know what to do," said the surgeon to one of the men.
"Well, Blunt," he continued, addressing the leader, "you're
saved&mdash;but your nine men in buckram have dwindled down
to one, and not a very creditable specimen at that," he said,
as his eyes followed the retreating Dumphy.</p>

<p>"I wish it were all, doctor," said Blunt simply; "I
would be willing to go back now, but something tells me
we have only begun. This one makes everything else
possible. What have you there?"</p>

<p>One of the men was approaching, holding a slip of paper
with ragged edges, as if torn from some position where it
had been nailed.</p>

<p>"A notiss&mdash;from a tree. Me no sabe," said the ex-vaquero.</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Blunt, looking at it; "it seems to be in
German. Call Glohr."</p>

<p>A tall Swiss came forward. Blunt handed him the paper.
The man examined it.</p>

<p>"It is a direction to find property&mdash;important and
valuable property&mdash;buried."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Under a cairn of stones."</p>

<p>The surgeon and Blunt exchanged glances.</p>

<p>"Lead us there!" said Blunt.</p>

<p>It was a muffled monotonous tramp of about an hour. At
the end of that time they reached a spur of the mountain
around which the cañon turned abruptly. Blunt uttered
a cry. Before them was a ruin&mdash;a rude heap of stones
originally symmetrical and elevated, but now thrown down
and dismantled. The snow and earth were torn up around
and beneath it. On the snow lay some scattered papers,
a portfolio of drawings of birds and flowers: a glass case
of insects broken and demolished, and the scattered feathers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
of a few stuffed birds. At a little distance lay what seemed
to be a heap of ragged clothing. At the sight of it the
nearest horseman uttered a shout and leaped to the ground.
It was Mrs. Brackett, dead.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER VII.</h4>

<h5>IN WHICH THE FOOTPRINTS BEGIN TO FADE.</h5>


<p>She had been dead about a week. The features and clothing
were scarcely recognizable; the limbs were drawn up
convulsively. The young surgeon bent over her attentively.</p>

<p>"Starved to death?" said Blunt interrogatively.</p>

<p>The surgeon did not reply, but rose and examined the
scattered specimens. One of them he picked up and
placed first to his nose and then to his lips. After a pause
he replied quietly&mdash;</p>

<p>"No. Poisoned."</p>

<p>The men fell back from the body.</p>

<p>"Accidentally, I think," continued the surgeon coolly;
"the poor creature has been driven by starvation to attack
the specimens. They have been covered with a strong
solution of arsenic to preserve them from the ravages of
insects, and this starving woman has been the first to fall
a victim to the collector's caution."</p>

<p>There was a general movement of horror and indignation
among the men. "Shoost to keep dem birds," said the
irate Swiss. "Killing women to save his cussed game,"
said another. The surgeon smiled. It was an inauspicious
moment for Dr. Devarges to have introduced himself
in person.</p>

<p>"If this enthusiastic naturalist is still living, I hope he'll
keep away from the men for some hours," said the surgeon
to Blunt, privately.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who is he?" asked the other.</p>

<p>"A foreigner&mdash;a <i>savant</i> of some note, I should say, in
his own country. I think I have heard the name before&mdash;'Devarges,'"
replied the surgeon, looking over some papers
that he had picked up. "He speaks of some surprising discoveries
he has made, and evidently valued his collection
very highly."</p>

<p>"Are they worth re-collecting and preserving?" asked
Blunt.</p>

<p>"Not now!" said the surgeon. "Every moment is
precious. Humanity first, science afterward," he added
lightly, and they rode on.</p>

<p>And so the papers and collections preserved with such
care, the evidence of many months of patient study, privation,
and hardship, the records of triumph and discovery
were left lying upon the snow. The wind came down the
flanks of the mountain and tossed them hither and thither
as if in scorn, and the sun, already fervid, heating the
metallic surfaces of the box and portfolio, sank them deeper
in the snow, as if to bury them from the sight for ever.</p>

<p>By skirting the edge of the valley where the snow had
fallen away from the mountain-side, they reached in a few
hours the blazed tree at the entrance of the fateful cañon.
The placard was still there, but the wooden hand that
once pointed in the direction of the buried huts had,
through some mischance of wind or weather, dropped
slightly, and was ominously pointing to the snow below.
This was still so deep in drifts that the party were obliged
to leave their horses and enter the cañon a-foot. Almost
unconsciously, this was done in perfect silence, walking in
single file, occasionally climbing up the sides of the cañon
where the rocks offered a better foothold than the damp
snow, until they reached a wooden chimney and part of a
roof that now reared itself above the snow. Here they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
paused and looked at each other. The leader approached
the chimney, and leaning over it called within.</p>

<p>There was no response. Presently, however, the cañon
took up the shout and repeated it, and then there was a
silence broken only by the falling of an icicle from a rock,
or a snow slide from the hill above. Then all was quiet
again, until Blunt, after a moment's hesitation, walked
around to the opening and descended into the hut. He
had scarcely disappeared, as it seemed, before he returned,
looking very white and grave, and beckoned to the surgeon.
He instantly followed. After a little, the rest of the party,
one after another, went down. They stayed some time,
and then came slowly to the surface bearing three dead
bodies. They returned again quickly, and then brought up
the <i>dissevered</i> members of a fourth. This done they looked
at each other in silence.</p>

<p>"There should be another cabin here," said Blunt after
a pause.</p>

<p>"Here it is!" said one of the men, pointing to the
chimney of the second hut.</p>

<p>There was no preliminary "hallo!" or hesitation now.
The worst was known. They all passed rapidly to the
opening, and disappeared within. When they returned to
the surface they huddled together&mdash;a whispering but excited
group. They were so much preoccupied that they did not
see that their party was suddenly increased by the presence
of a stranger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER VIII.</h4>

<h5>THE FOOTPRINTS GROW FAINTER.</h5>


<p>It was Philip Ashley! Philip Ashley&mdash;faded, travel-worn,
hollow-eyed, but nervously energetic and eager. Philip,
who four days before had left Grace the guest of a hospitable
trapper's half-breed family in the California Valley.
Philip&mdash;gloomy, discontented, hateful of the quest he had
undertaken, but still fulfilling his promise to Grace and
the savage dictates of his own conscience. It was Philip
Ashley, who now standing beside the hut, turned half-cynically,
half-indifferently toward the party.</p>

<p>The surgeon was first to discover him. He darted forward
with a cry of recognition, "Poinsett! Arthur!&mdash;what
are you doing here?"</p>

<p>Ashley's face flushed crimson at the sight of the stranger.
"Hush!" he said almost involuntarily. He glanced rapidly
around the group, and then in some embarrassment replied
with awkward literalness, "I left my horse with the others
at the entrance of the cañon."</p>

<p>"I see," said the surgeon briskly, "you have come with
relief like ourselves; but you are too late! too late!"</p>

<p>"Too late!" echoed Ashley.</p>

<p>"Yes, they are all dead or gone!"</p>

<p>A singular expression crossed Ashley's face. It was
unnoticed by the surgeon, who was whispering to Blunt.
Presently he came forward.</p>

<p>"Captain Blunt, this is Lieutenant Poinsett of the Fifth
Infantry, an old messmate mine, whom I have not met
before for two years. He is here, like ourselves, on an
errand of mercy. It is like him!"</p>

<p>The unmistakable air of high breeding and intelligence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
which distinguished Philip always, and the cordial endorsement
of the young surgeon, prepossessed the party instantly
in his favour. With that recognition, something of his singular
embarrassment dropped away.</p>

<p>"Who are those people?" he ventured at last to say.</p>

<p>"Their names are on this paper, which we found nailed
to a tree. Of course, with no survivor present, we are unable
to identify them all. The hut occupied by Dr. Devarges,
whose body, buried in the snow, we have identified by his
clothing, and the young girl Grace Conroy and her child-sister,
are the only ones we are positive about."</p>

<p>Philip looked at the doctor.</p>

<p>"How have you identified the young girl?"</p>

<p>"By her clothing, which was marked."</p>

<p>Philip remembered that Grace had changed her clothes
for the suit of a younger brother who was dead.</p>

<p>"Only by that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No. Dr. Devarges in his papers gives the names of the
occupants of the hut. We have accounted for all but her
brother, and a fellow by the name of Ashley."</p>

<p>"How do you account for them?" asked Philip with a
dark face.</p>

<p>"Ran away! What can you expect from that class of
people?" said the surgeon with a contemptuous shrug.</p>

<p>"What class?" asked Philip almost savagely.</p>

<p>"My dear boy," said the surgeon, "you know them as
well as I. Didn't they always pass the Fort where we were
stationed? Didn't they beg what they could, and steal
what they otherwise couldn't get, and then report to Washington
the incompetency of the military? Weren't they
always getting up rows with the Indians and then sneaking
away to let us settle the bill? Don't you remember them&mdash;the
men gaunt, sickly, vulgar, low-toned; the women dirty,
snuffy, prematurely old and prematurely prolific?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>Philip tried to combat this picture with his recollection
of Grace's youthful features, but somehow failed. Within
the last half-hour his instinctive fastidiousness had increased
a hundredfold. He looked at the doctor, and said "Yes."</p>

<p>"Of course," said the surgeon. "It was the old lot.
What could you expect? People who could be strong
only in proportion to their physical strength, and losing
everything with the loss of that? There have been selfishness,
cruelty&mdash;God knows&mdash;perhaps murder done here!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Philip, hastily; "but you were speaking
of this girl, Grace Conroy; what do you know of her?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, except that she was found lying there dead
with her name on her clothes and her sister's blanket in her
arms, as if the wretches had stolen the dying child from the
dead girl's arms. But you, Arthur, how chanced you to be
here in this vicinity? Are you stationed here?"</p>

<p>"No, I have resigned from the army."</p>

<p>"Good! and you are here"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Alone!"</p>

<p>"Come, we will talk this over as we return. You will
help me make out my report. This you know, is an official
inquiry, based upon the alleged clairvoyant quality of our
friend Blunt. I must say we have established that fact, if
we have been able to do nothing more."</p>

<p>The surgeon then lightly sketched an account of the expedition,
from its inception in a dream of Blunt (who was
distinctly impressed with the fact that a number of emigrants
were perishing from hunger in the Sierras) to his meeting
with Philip, with such deftness of cynical humour and playful
satire&mdash;qualities that had lightened the weariness of the
mess-table of Fort Bobadil&mdash;that the young men were both
presently laughing. Two or three of the party who had been
engaged in laying out the unburied bodies, and talking in
whispers, hearing these fine gentlemen make light of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
calamity in well-chosen epithets, were somewhat ashamed
of their own awe, and less elegantly, and I fear less grammatically,
began to be jocose too. Whereat the fastidious
Philip frowned, the surgeon laughed, and the two friends
returned to the entrance of the cañon, and thence rode out
of the valley together.</p>

<p>Philip's reticence regarding his own immediate past was
too characteristic to excite any suspicion or surprise in the
mind of his friend. In truth, the doctor was too well
pleased with his presence, and the undoubted support which
he should have in Philip's sympathetic tastes and congenial
habits, to think of much else. He was proud of his friend&mdash;proud
of the impression he had made among the rude
unlettered men with whom he was forced by the conditions
of frontier democracy to associate on terms of equality.
And Philip, though young, was accustomed to have his
friends proud of him. Indeed, he always felt some complacency
with himself that he seldom took advantage of
this fact. Satisfied that he might have confided to the
doctor the truth of his connection with the ill-fated party
and his flight with Grace, and that the doctor would
probably have regarded him as a hero, he felt less compunction
at his suppression of the fact.</p>

<p>Their way lay by Monument Point and the dismantled
cairn. Philip had already passed it on his way to the
cañon, and had felt a thankfulness for the unexpected
tragedy that had, as he believed, conscientiously relieved
him of a duty to the departed naturalist, yet he could not
forego a question.</p>

<p>"Is there anything among these papers and collections
worth our preserving?" he asked the surgeon.</p>

<p>The doctor, who had not for many months had an
opportunity to air his general scepticism, was nothing if not
derogatory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," he answered, shortly. "If there were any way
that we might restore them to the living Dr. Devarges, they
might minister to his vanity, and please the poor fellow. I
see nothing in them that should make them worthy to survive
him."</p>

<p>The tone was so like Dr. Devarges' own manner, as
Philip remembered it, that he smiled grimly and felt
relieved. When they reached the spot Nature seemed to
have already taken the same cynical view; the metallic case
was already deeply sunken in the snow, the wind had
scattered the papers far and wide, and even the cairn itself
had tumbled into a shapeless, meaningless ruin.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER IX.</h4>

<h5>IN WHICH THE FOOTPRINTS ARE LOST FOR EVER.</h5>


<p>A fervid May sun had been baking the adobe walls of the
Presidio of San Ramon, firing the red tiles, scorching the
black courtyard, and driving the mules and vaqueros of a
train that had just arrived into the shade of the long
galleries of the quadrangle, when the <i>Comandante</i>, who was
taking his noonday <i>siesta</i> in a low, studded chamber beside
the guard-room, was gently awakened by his secretary. For
thirty years the noonday slumbers of the Commander had
never been broken; his first thought was the heathen!&mdash;his
first impulse to reach for his trusty Toledo. But, as it
so happened, the cook had borrowed it that morning to
rake <i>tortillas</i> from the Presidio oven, and Don Juan
Salvatierra contented himself with sternly demanding the
reason for this unwonted intrusion.</p>

<p>"A señorita&mdash;an American&mdash;desires an immediate
audience."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>Don Juan removed the black silk handkerchief which he
had tied round his grizzled brows, and sat up. Before
he could assume a more formal attitude, the door was
timidly opened, and a young girl entered. For all the
disfigurement of scant, coarse, ill-fitting clothing, or the
hollowness of her sweet eyes, and even the tears that
dimmed their long lashes; for all the sorrow that had
pinched her young cheek and straightened the corners of
her childlike mouth, she was still so fair, so frank, so youthful,
so innocent and helpless, that the <i>Comandante</i> stood
erect, and then bent forward in a salutation that almost
swept the floor. Apparently the prepossession was mutual.
The young girl took a quick survey of the gaunt but gentlemanlike
figure before her, cast a rapid glance at the serious
but kindly eyes that shone above the Commander's iron-grey
mustachios, dropped her hesitating, timid manner, and,
with an impulsive gesture and a little cry, ran forward and
fell upon her knees at his feet. The Commander would
have raised her gently, but she restrained his hand.</p>

<p>"No, no, listen! I am only a poor, poor girl, without
friends or home. A month ago, I left my family starving
in the mountains, and came away to get them help. My
brother came with me. God was good to us, Señor, and
after a weary tramp of many days we found a trapper's hut,
and food and shelter. Philip, my brother, went back alone
to succour them. He has not returned. Oh, sir, he may
be dead; they all may be dead&mdash;God only knows! It is
three weeks ago since he left me; three weeks! It is a
long time to be alone, Señor, a stranger in a strange
land. The trapper was kind, and sent me here to you for
assistance. You will help me? I know you will. You
will find them, my friends, my little sister, my brother!"</p>

<p>The Commander waited until she had finished, and then
gently lifted her to a seat by his side. Then he turned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
his secretary, who, with a few hurried words in Spanish,
answered the mute inquiry of the Commander's eyes. The
young girl felt a thrill of disappointment as she saw that
her personal appeal had been lost and unintelligible; it
was with a slight touch of defiance that was new to her
nature that she turned to the secretary who advanced as
interpreter.</p>

<p>"You are an American?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the girl, curtly, who had taken one of the
strange, swift, instinctive dislikes of her sex to the man.</p>

<p>"How many years?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen."</p>

<p>The Commander, almost unconsciously, laid his brown
hand on her clustering curls.</p>

<p>"Name?"</p>

<p>She hesitated and looked at the Commander.</p>

<p>"Grace," she said.</p>

<p>Then she hesitated; and, with a defiant glance at the
secretary, added&mdash;</p>

<p>"Grace Ashley!"</p>

<p>"Give to me the names of some of your company, Mees
Graziashly."</p>

<p>Grace hesitated.</p>

<p>"Philip Ashley, Gabriel Conroy, Peter Dumphy, Mrs.
Jane Dumphy," she said at last.</p>

<p>The secretary opened a desk, took out a printed document,
unfolded it, and glanced over its contents. Presently
he handed it to the Commander with the comment "<i>Bueno.</i>"
The Commander said "<i>Bueno</i>" also, and glanced kindly
and reassuringly at Grace.</p>

<p>"An expedition from the upper Presidio has found traces
of a party of Americans in the Sierra," said the secretary
monotonously. "There are names like these."</p>

<p>"It is the same&mdash;it is our party!" said Grace, joyously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>"You say so?" said the secretary, cautiously.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Grace, defiantly.</p>

<p>The secretary glanced at the paper again, and then said,
looking at Grace intently&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is no name of Mees Graziashly."</p>

<p>The hot blood suddenly dyed the cheek of Grace and
her eyelids dropped. She raised her eyes imploringly to
the Commander. If she could have reached him directly,
she would have thrown herself at his feet and confessed her
innocent deceit, but she shrank from a confidence that first
filtered through the consciousness of the secretary. So she
began to fence feebly with the issue.</p>

<p>"It is a mistake," she said. "But the name of Philip,
my brother, is there?"</p>

<p>"The name of Philip Ashley is here," said the secretary,
grimly.</p>

<p>"And he is alive and safe!" cried Grace, forgetting in
her relief and joy her previous shame and mortification.</p>

<p>"He is not found," said the secretary.</p>

<p>"Not found?" said Grace, with widely opened eyes.</p>

<p>"He is not there."</p>

<p>"No, of course," said Grace, with a nervous hysterical
laugh; "he was with me; but he came back&mdash;he returned."</p>

<p>"On the 30th of April there is no record of the finding
of Philip Ashley."</p>

<p>Grace groaned and clasped her hands. In her greater
anxiety now, all lesser fears were forgotten. She turned
and threw herself before the Commander.</p>

<p>"Oh, forgive me, Señor, but I swear to you I meant no
harm! Philip is not my brother, but a friend, so kind, so
good. He asked me to take his name, poor boy, God
knows if he will ever claim it again, and I did. My name
is not Ashley. I know not what is in that paper, but it
must tell of my brother, Gabriel, my sister, of all! O,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Señor, are they living or dead? Answer me you must&mdash;for&mdash;I
am&mdash;I am Grace Conroy!"</p>

<p>The secretary had refolded the paper. He opened it
again, glanced over it, fixed his eyes upon Grace, and,
pointing to a paragraph, handed it to the Commander.
The two men exchanged glances, the Commander coughed,
rose, and averted his face from the beseeching eyes of
Grace. A sudden death-like chill ran through her limbs
as, at a word from the Commander, the secretary rose and
placed the paper in her hands.</p>

<p>Grace took it with trembling fingers. It seemed to be a
proclamation in Spanish.</p>

<p>"I cannot read it," she said, stamping her little foot with
passionate vehemence. "Tell me what it says."</p>

<p>At a sign from the Commander, the secretary opened the
paper and arose. The Commander, with his face averted,
looked through the open window. The light streaming
through its deep, tunnel-like embrasure, fell upon the central
figure of Grace, with her shapely head slightly bent forward,
her lips apart, and her eager, passionate eyes fixed
upon the Commander. The secretary cleared his throat in
a perfunctory manner; and, with the conscious pride of an
irreproachable linguist, began&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"NOTICE.</p>

<p>"TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE COMANDANTE OF THE PRESIDIO OF
SAN FELIPE.
</p>

<p>"I have the honour to report that the expedition sent out to relieve
certain distressed emigrants in the fastnesses of the Sierra Nevadas,
said expedition being sent on the information of Don José Bluent of
San Geronimo, found in a cañon east of the Canada del Diablo the
evidences of the recent existence of such emigrants buried in the snow,
and the melancholy and deeply-to-be-deplored record of their sufferings,
abandonment, and death. A written record preserved by these
miserable and most infelicitous ones gives the names and history of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>organisation, known as 'Captain Conroy's Party,' a copy of which is
annexed below.</p>

<p>"The remains of five of these unfortunates were recovered from the
snow, but it was impossible to identify but two, who were buried with
sacred and reverential rites.</p>

<p>"Our soldiers behaved with that gallantry, coolness, patriotism, inflexible
hardihood, and high-principled devotion which ever animate
the swelling heart of the Mexican warrior. Nor can too much praise
be given to the voluntary efforts of one Don Arthur Poinsett, late
Lieutenant of the Army of the United States of America, who, though
himself a voyager and a stranger, assisted our commander in the efforts
of humanity.</p>

<p>"The wretched dead appeared to have expired from hunger, although
one was evidently a victim"&mdash;&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>The tongue of the translator hesitated a moment, and
then with an air of proud superiority to the difficulties of
the English language, he resumed&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"A victim to fly poison. It is to be regretted that among the victims
was the famous Doctor Paul Devarges, a Natural, and collector of
the stuffed Bird and Beast, a name most illustrious in science."</p></blockquote>

<p>The secretary paused, his voice dropped its pretentious
pitch, he lifted his eyes from the paper, and fixing them on
Grace, repeated, deliberately&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The bodies who were identified were those of Paul Devarges and
Grace Conroy."</p></blockquote>

<p>"Oh, no! no!" said Grace, clasping her hands, wildly;
"it is a mistake! You are trying to frighten me, a poor,
helpless, friendless girl! You are punishing me, gentlemen,
because you know I have done wrong, because you think I
have lied! Oh, have pity, gentlemen. My God&mdash;save me&mdash;Philip!"</p>

<p>And with a loud, despairing cry, she rose to her feet,
caught at the clustering tendrils of her hair, raised her little
hands, palms upward, high in the air, and then sank perpendicularly,
as if crushed and beaten flat, a pale and senseless
heap upon the floor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>The Commander stooped over the prostrate girl. "Send
Manuela here," he said quickly, waving aside the proffered
aid of the secretary, with an impatient gesture quite unlike
his usual gravity, as he lifted the unconscious Grace in his
arms.</p>

<p>An Indian waiting-woman hurriedly appeared, and assisted
the Commander to lay the fainting girl upon a couch.</p>

<p>"Poor child!" said the Commander, as Manuela, bending
over Grace, unloosed her garments with sympathetic
feminine hands. "Poor little one, and without a father!"</p>

<p>"Poor woman!" said Manuela to herself, half aloud;
"and without a husband."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>AFTER FIVE YEARS.</i></h3>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

<h5>ONE HORSE GULCH.</h5>


<p>It was a season of unexampled prosperity in One Horse
Gulch. Even the despondent original locator, who, in a fit
of depressed alcoholism, had given it that infelicitous title,
would have admitted its injustice, but that he fell a victim
to the "craftily qualified" cups of San Francisco long before
the Gulch had become prosperous. "Hed Jim stuck to
straight whisky he might hev got his pile outer the very
ledge whar his cabin stood," said a local critic. But Jim
did not; after taking a thousand dollars from his claim, he
had flown to San Franciscos, where, gorgeously arrayed, he
had flitted from champagne to cognac, and from gin to lager
beer, until he brought his gilded and ephemeral existence
to a close in the country hospital.</p>

<p>Howbeit, One Horse Gulch survived not only its godfather,
but the baleful promise of its unhallowed christening. It
had its Hotel and its Temperance House, its Express office,
its saloons, its two squares of low wooden buildings in the
main street, its clustering nests of cabins on the hill-sides,
its freshly-hewn stumps, and its lately-cleared lots. Young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
in years, it still had its memories, experiences and antiquities.
The first tent pitched by Jim White was still standing, the
bullet holes were yet to be seen in the shutters of the
Cachucha saloon, where the great fight took place between
Boston Joe, Harry Worth, and Thompson of Angel's; from
the upper loft of Watson's "Emporium" a beam still projected
from which a year ago a noted citizen had been
suspended, after an informal inquiry into the ownership
of some mules that he was found possessed of. Near it was
a small unpretentious square shed, where the famous caucus
had met that had selected the delegates who chose the
celebrated and Honourable Blank to represent California in
the councils of the nation.</p>

<p>It was raining. Not in the usual direct, honest, perpendicular
fashion of that mountain region, but only suggestively,
and in a vague, uncertain sort of way, as if it might at any
time prove to be fog or mist, and any money wagered upon
it would be hazardous. It was raining as much from below
as above, and the lower limbs of the loungers who gathered
around the square box stove that stood in Briggs's warehouse,
exhaled a cloud of steam. The loungers in Briggs's were
those who from deficiency of taste or the requisite capital
avoided the gambling and drinking saloons, and quietly
appropriated biscuits from the convenient barrel of the
generous Briggs, or filled their pipes from his open tobacco
canisters, with the general suggestion in their manner that
their company fully compensated for any waste of his
material.</p>

<p>They had been smoking silently&mdash;a silence only broken
by the occasional hiss of expectoration against the hot stove,
when the door of a back room opened softly, and Gabriel
Conroy entered.</p>

<p>"How is he gettin' on, Gabe?" asked one of the loungers.</p>

<p>"So, so," said Gabriel. "You'll want to shift those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
bandages again," he said, turning to Briggs, "afore the
doctor comes. I'd come back in an hour, but I've got to
drop in and see how Steve's gettin' on, and it's a matter of
two miles from home."</p>

<p>"But he says he won't let anybody tech him but you,"
said Mr. Briggs.</p>

<p>"I know he <i>says</i> so," said Gabriel, soothingly; "but he'll
get over that. That's what Stimson sed when he was took
worse, but he got over that, and I never got to see him except
in time to lay him out."</p>

<p>The justice of this was admitted even by Briggs, although
evidently disappointed. Gabriel was walking to the door,
when another voice from the stove stopped him.</p>

<p>"Oh, Gabe! you mind that emigrant family with the sick
baby camped down the gulch! Well, the baby up and died
last night."</p>

<p>"I want to know," said Gabriel, with thoughtful gravity.</p>

<p>"Yes, and that woman's in a heap of trouble. Couldn't
you kinder drop in in passing and look after things?"</p>

<p>"I will," said Gabriel thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I thought you'd like to know it, and I thought she'd like
me to tell you," said the speaker, settling himself back again
over the stove with the air of a man who had just fulfilled,
at great personal sacrifice and labour, a work of supererogation.</p>

<p>"You're always thoughtful of other folks, Johnson," said
Briggs, admiringly.</p>

<p>"Well, yes," said Johnson, with a modest serenity; "I
allers allow that men in Californy ought to think of others
besides themselves. A little keer and a little <i>sabe</i> on my
part, and there's that family in the gulch made comfortable
with Gabe around 'em."</p>

<p>Meanwhile this homely inciter of the unselfish virtues of
One Horse Gulch had passed out into the rain and darkness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
So conscientiously did he fulfil his various obligations,
that it was nearly one o'clock before he reached his
rude hut on the hill-side, a rough cabin of pine logs, so
unpretentious and wild in exterior as to be but a slight improvement
on nature. The vines clambered unrestrainedly
over the bark-thatched roof; the birds occupied the crevices
of the walls, the squirrel ate his acorns on the ridge pole
without fear and without reproach.</p>

<p>Softly drawing the wooden peg that served as a bolt,
Gabriel entered with that noiselessness and caution that
were habitual to him. Lighting a candle by the embers of
a dying fire, he carefully looked around him. The cabin
was divided into two compartments by the aid of a canvas
stretched between the walls, with a flap for the doorway.
On a pine table lay several garments apparently belonging
to a girl of seven or eight&mdash;a frock grievously rent and torn,
a frayed petticoat of white flannel already patched with
material taken from a red shirt, and a pair of stockings so
excessively and sincerely darned, as to have lost nearly all
of their original fabric in repeated bits of relief that covered
almost the entire structure. Gabriel looked at these articles
ruefully, and, slowly picking them up, examined each with
the greatest gravity and concern. Then he took off his
coat and boots, and having in this way settled himself into
an easy dishabille, he took a box from the shelf, and proceeded
to lay out thread and needles, when he was interrupted
by a child's voice from behind the canvas screen.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Gabe?"&mdash;"Yes."</p>

<p>"Oh, Gabe, I got tired and went to bed."</p>

<p>"I see you did," said Gabriel drily, picking up a needle
and thread that had apparently been abandoned after a
slight excursion into the neighbourhood of a rent and left
hopelessly sticking in the petticoat.</p>

<p>"Yes, Gabe; they're so awfully old!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Old!" repeated Gabe, reproachfully. "Old! Lettin'
on a little wear and tear, they're as good as they ever were.
That petticoat is stronger," said Gabriel, holding up the
garment and eyeing the patches with a slight glow of artistic
pride&mdash;"stronger, Olly, than the first day you put it on."</p>

<p>"But that's five years ago, Gabe."</p>

<p>"Well," said Gabriel, turning round and addressing himself
impatiently to the screen, "wot if it is?"</p>

<p>"And I've growed."</p>

<p>"Growed!" said Gabriel, scornfully. "And haven't I let
out the tucks, and didn't I put three fingers of the best sacking
around the waist? You'll just ruin me in clothes."</p>

<p>Olly laughed from behind the screen. Finding, however,
no response from the grim worker, presently there appeared
a curly head at the flap, and then a slim little girl, in the
scantiest of nightgowns, ran, and began to nestle at his side,
and to endeavour to enwrap herself in his waistcoat.</p>

<p>"Oh, go 'way!" said Gabriel, with a severe voice and
the most shameless signs of relenting in his face. "Go
away! What do you care? Here I might slave myself to
death to dress you in silks and satins, and you'd dip into
the first ditch or waltz through the first underbrush that you
kem across. You haven't got no <i>sabe</i> in dress, Olly. It
ain't ten days ago as I iron-bound and copper-fastened that
dress, so to speak, and look at it now! Olly, look at it
now!" And he held it up indignantly before the maiden.</p>

<p>Olly placed the top of her head against the breast of her
brother as a <i>point d'appui</i>, and began to revolve around him
as if she wished to bore a way into his inmost feelings.</p>

<p>"Oh, you ain't mad, Gabe!" she said, leaping first over
one knee and then over the other without lifting her head.
"You ain't mad!"</p>

<p>Gabriel did not deign to reply, but continued mending
the frayed petticoat in dignified silence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who did you see down town?" said Olly, not at all
rebuffed.</p>

<p>"No one," said Gabriel, shortly.</p>

<p>"You did! You smell of linnyments and peppermint,"
said Olly, with a positive shake of the head. "You've been
to Briggs's and the new family up the gulch."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Gabriel, "that Mexican's legs is better, but
the baby's dead. Jest remind me, to-morrow, to look
through mother's things for suthin' for that poor woman."</p>

<p>"Gabe, do you know what Mrs. Markle says of you?"
said Olly, suddenly raising her head.</p>

<p>"No," replied Gabriel, with an affectation of indifference
that, like all his affectations, was a perfect failure.</p>

<p>"She says," said Olly, "that you want to be looked after
yourself more'n all these people. She says you're just
throwing yourself away on other folks. She says I ought
to have a woman to look after me."</p>

<p>Gabriel stopped his work, laid down the petticoat, and
taking the curly head of Olly between his knees, with one
hand beneath her chin and the other on the top of her
head, turned her mischievous face towards his. "Olly,"
he said, seriously, "when I got you outer the snow at
Starvation Camp; when I toted you on my back for miles
till we got into the valley; when we lay by thar for two
weeks, and me a felling trees and picking up provisions
here and thar, in the wood or the river, wharever thar was
bird or fish, I reckon you got along as well&mdash;I won't say
better&mdash;ez if you had a woman to look arter you. When
at last we kem here to this camp, and I built this yer house,
I don't think any woman could hev done better. If they
could, I'm wrong, and Mrs. Markle's right."</p>

<p>Olly began to be uncomfortable. Then the quick instincts
of her sex came to her relief, and she archly assumed
the aggressive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think Mrs. Markle likes you, Gabe."</p>

<p>Gabriel looked down at the little figure in alarm. There
are some subjects whereof the youngest of womankind
has an instinctive knowledge that makes the wisest of us
tremble.</p>

<p>"Go to bed, Olly," said the cowardly Gabriel.</p>

<p>But Olly wanted to sit up, so she changed the subject.</p>

<p>"The Mexican you're tendin' isn't a Mexican, he's a
Chileno; Mrs. Markle says so."</p>

<p>"Maybe; it's all the same. <i>I</i> call him a Mexican. He
talks too straight, anyway," said Gabriel, indifferently.</p>

<p>"Did he ask you any more questions about&mdash;about old
times?" continued the girl.</p>

<p>"Yes; he wanted to know everything that happened in
Starvation Camp. He was rek'larly took with poor Gracie;
asked a heap o' questions about her&mdash;how she acted, and
seemed to feel as bad as we did about never hearing anything
from her. I never met a man, Olly, afore, as seemed
to take such an interest in other folks' sorrers as he did.
You'd have tho't he'd been one of the party. And he made
me tell him all about Dr. Devarges."</p>

<p>"And Philip?" queried Olly.</p>

<p>"No," said Gabriel, somewhat curtly.</p>

<p>"Gabriel," said Olly, sullenly, "I wish you didn't talk so
to people about those days."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Gabriel, wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Because it ain't good to talk about. Gabriel dear," she
continued, with a slight quivering of the upper lip, "sometimes
I think the people round yer look upon us sorter
queer. That little boy that came here with the emigrant
family wouldn't play with me, and Mrs. Markle's little girl
said that we did dreadful things up there in the snow. He
said I was a cannon-ball."</p>

<p>"A what?" asked Gabriel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>"A cannon-ball! He said that you and I"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hush," interrupted Gabriel, sternly, as an angry flush
came into his sunburnt cheek, "I'll jest bust that boy if I see
him round yer agin."</p>

<p>"But, Gabriel," persisted Olly, "nobody"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will you go to bed, Olly, and not catch your death yer
on this cold floor asking ornery and perfectly ridickulus
questions?" said Gabriel, briskly, lifting her to her feet.
"Thet Markle girl ain't got no sense anyway&mdash;she's allers
leading you round in ditches, ruinin' your best clothes, and
keepin' me up half the night mendin' on 'em."</p>

<p>Thus admonished, Olly retreated behind the canvas
screen, and Gabriel resumed his needle and thread. But
the thread became entangled, and was often snappishly
broken, and Gabriel sewed imaginary, vindictive stitches in
the imaginary calves of an imaginary youthful emigrant,
until Olly's voice again broke the silence.</p>

<p>"Oh, Gabe!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Gabriel, putting down his work despairingly.</p>

<p>"Do you think&mdash;that Philip&mdash;ate Grace?"</p>

<p>Gabriel rose swiftly, and disappeared behind the screen.
As he did so, the door softly opened, and a man stepped
into the cabin. The new-comer cast a rapid glance around
the dimly-lighted room, and then remained motionless in the
doorway. From behind the screen came the sound of voices.
The stranger hesitated, and then uttered a slight cough.</p>

<p>In an instant Gabriel reappeared. The look of angry
concern at the intrusion turned to one of absolute stupefaction
as he examined the stranger more attentively. The
new-comer smiled faintly, yet politely, and then, with a
slight halt in his step, moved towards a chair, into which he
dropped with a deprecating gesture.</p>

<p>"I shall sit&mdash;and you shall pardon me. You have surprise!
Yes? Five, six hour ago you leave me very sick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
on a bed&mdash;where you are so kind&mdash;so good. Yes? Ah?
You see me here now, and you say crazy! Mad!"</p>

<p>He raised his right hand with the fingers upward, twirled
them to signify Gabriel's supposed idea of a whirling brain,
and smiled again.</p>

<p>"Listen. Comes to me an hour ago a message most
important. Most necessary it is I go to-night&mdash;now, to
Marysville. You see. Yes? I rise and dress myself.
Ha! I have great strength for the effort. I am better.
But I say to myself, 'Victor, you shall first pay your
respects to the good Pike who have been so kind, so good.
You shall press the hand of the noble grand miner who
have recover you. <i>Bueno</i>, I am here!"</p>

<p>He extended a thin, nervous brown hand, and for the
first time since his entrance concentrated his keen black
eyes, which had roved over the apartment and taken in its
minutest details, upon his host. Gabriel, lost in bewilderment,
could only gasp&mdash;"But you ain't well enough, you
know. You can't walk yet. You'll kill yourself!"</p>

<p>The stranger smiled.</p>

<p>"Yes?&mdash;you think&mdash;you think? Look now! Waits me,
outside, the horse of the livery-stable man. How many
miles you think to the stage town? Fifteen." (He emphasized
them with his five uplifted fingers.) "It is nothing.
Two hour comes the stage and I am there. Ha!"</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, with a gesture, as if brushing away all
difficulties, his keen eyes were resting upon a little shelf
above the chimney, whereon stood an old-fashioned daguerreotype
case open. He rose, and, with a slight halting step
and an expression of pain, limped across the room to the
shelf, and took up the daguerreotype.</p>

<p>"What have we?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It is Gracie," said Gabriel, brightening up. "Taken
the day we started from St. Jo."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>"How long?"</p>

<p>"Six years ago. She was fourteen then," said Gabriel,
taking the case in his hand and brushing the glass fondly
with his palm. "Thar warn't no puttier gal in all Missouri,"
he added, with fraternal pride, looking down upon the
picture with moistened eyes. "Eh&mdash;what did you say?"</p>

<p>The stranger had uttered a few words hastily in a foreign
tongue. But they were apparently complimentary, for when
Gabriel looked up at him with an inquiring glance, he was
smiling and saying, "Beautiful! Angelic! Very pretty!"
with eyes still fixed upon the picture. "And it is like&mdash;ah,
I see the brother's face, too," he said, gravely, comparing
Gabriel's face with the picture. Gabriel looked pleased.
Any nature less simple than his would have detected the
polite fiction. In the square, honest face of the brother
there was not the faintest suggestion of the delicate, girlish,
poetical oval before him.</p>

<p>"It is precious," said the stranger: "and it is all, ha?"</p>

<p>"All?" echoed Gabriel, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"You have nothing more?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"A line of her writing, a letter, her private papers would
be a treasure, eh?"</p>

<p>"She left nothing," said Gabriel, simply, "but her clothes.
You know she put on a boy's suit&mdash;Johnny's clothes&mdash;when
she left. Thet's how it allus puzzles me thet they
knew <i>who</i> she was, when they came across the poor child
dead."</p>

<p>The stranger did not speak, and Gabriel went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was nigh on a month afore I got back. When I did,
the snow was gone, and there warn't no track or trace of
anybody. Then I heerd the story I told ye&mdash;thet a relief
party had found 'em all dead&mdash;and thet among the dead
was Grace. How that poor child ever got back thar alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
(for thar warn't no trace or mention of the man she went
away with) is what gets me. And that there's my trouble,
Mr. Ramirez! To think of thet pooty darlin' climbing
back to the old nest, and finding no one thar! To think
of her coming back, as she allowed, to Olly and me, and
findin' all her own blood gone, is suthin' thet, at times,
drives me almost mad. She didn't die of starvation; she
didn't die of cold. Her heart was broke, Mr. Ramirez;
her little heart was broke!"</p>

<p>The stranger looked at him curiously, but did not speak.
After a moment's pause, he lifted his bowed head from his
hands, wiped his eyes with Olly's flannel petticoat, and
went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"For more than a year I tried to get sight o' that report.
Then I tried to find the Mission or the Presidio that the
relief party started from, and may be see some of that party.
But then kem the gold excitement, and the Americans took
possession of the Missions and Presidios, and when I got to
San&mdash;San&mdash;San&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Geronimo," interrupted Ramirez, hastily.</p>

<p>"Did I tell?" asked Gabriel, simply; "I don't remember
that."</p>

<p>Ramirez showed all his teeth in quick assent, and
motioned him with his finger to go on.</p>

<p>"When I got to San Geronimo, there was nobody, and
no records left. Then I put a notiss in the San Francisco
paper for Philip Ashley&mdash;that was the man as helped her
away&mdash;to communicate with me. But thar weren't no
answer."</p>

<p>Ramirez rose.</p>

<p>"You are not rich, friend Gabriel?"</p>

<p>"No," said Gabriel.</p>

<p>"But you expect&mdash;ah&mdash;you expect?"</p>

<p>"Well, I reckon some day to make a strike like the rest."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Anywhere, my friend?"</p>

<p>"Anywhere," repeated Gabriel, smiling.</p>

<p>"<i>Adios</i>," said the stranger, going to the door.</p>

<p>"<i>Adios</i>," repeated Gabriel. "Must you go to-night?
What's your hurry? You're sure you feel better now?"</p>

<p>"Better?" answered Ramirez, with a singular smile.
"Better! Look, I am so strong!"</p>

<p>He stretched out his arms, and expanded his chest, and
walked erect to the door.</p>

<p>"You have cured my rheumatism, friend Gabriel.
Good night."</p>

<p>The door closed behind him. In another moment he
was in the saddle, and speeding so swiftly that, in spite of mud
and darkness, in two hours he had reached the mining town
where the Wingdam and Sacramento stage-coach changed
horses. The next morning, while Olly and Gabriel were
eating breakfast, Mr. Victor Ramirez stepped briskly from
the stage that drew up at Marysville Hotel, and entered the
hotel office. As the clerk looked up inquiringly, Mr.
Ramirez handed him a card&mdash;</p>

<p>"Send that, if you please, to Miss Grace Conroy."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

<h5>MADAME DEVARGES.</h5>


<p>Mr. Ramirez followed the porter upstairs, and along a
narrow passage, until he reached a larger hall. Here the
porter indicated that he should wait until he returned, and
then disappeared down the darkened vista of another passage.
Mr. Ramirez had ample time to observe the freshness of the
boarded partitions and scant details of the interior of the
International Hotel; he even had time to attempt to grapple
the foreign mystery of the notice conspicuously on the wall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
"Gentlemen are requested not to sleep on the stairs," before
his companion reappeared. Beckoning to Mr. Ramirez,
with an air of surly suspicion, the porter led him along the
darkened passage until he paused before a door at its farther
extremity and knocked gently. Slight as was the knock, it
had the mysterious effect of causing all the other doors
along the passage to open, and a masculine head to appear
at each opening. Mr. Ramirez's brow darkened quickly.
He was sufficiently conversant with the conditions of that
early civilization to know that, as a visitor to a lady, he was
the object of every man's curious envy and aggressive suspicion.
There was the sound of light footsteps within, and
the door opened. The porter lingered long enough to be
able to decide upon the character and propriety of the
greeting, and then sullenly retired. The door closed, and
Mr. Ramirez found himself face to face with the occupant of
the room. She was a small, slight blonde, who, when the
smile that had lit her mouth and eyes as she opened the
door faded suddenly as she closed it, might have passed for
a plain, indistinctive woman. But for a certain dangerous
submissiveness of manner&mdash;which I here humbly submit is
always to be feared in an all-powerful sex&mdash;and an address
that was rather more deprecatory than occasion called for,
she would hardly have awakened the admiration of our sex
or the fears of her own.</p>

<p>As Ramirez advanced, with both hands impulsively extended,
she drew back shyly, and, pointing to the ceiling
and walls, said quietly, "Cloth and paper!"</p>

<p>Ramirez's dark face grew darker. There was a long pause.
Suddenly the lady lightened the shadow that seemed to have
fallen upon their interview with both her teeth and eyes, and,
pointing to a chair, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sit down, Victor, and tell me why you have returned so
soon."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>Victor sat sullenly down. The lady looked all deprecation
and submissiveness, but said nothing.</p>

<p>Ramirez would, in his sullenness, have imitated her, but
his natural impulsiveness was too strong, and he broke out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look! From the book of the hotel it is better you
should erase the name of Grace Conroy, and put down
your own!"</p>

<p>"And why, Victor?"</p>

<p>"She asks why," said Victor, appealing to the ceiling.
"My God! Because one hundred miles from here live the
brother and sister of Grace Conroy. I have seen him!"</p>

<p>"Well."</p>

<p>"Well," echoed Victor. "Is it well? Listen. You shall
hear if it is well."</p>

<p>He drew his chair beside her, and went on in a low,
earnest voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have at last located the mine. I followed the <i>deseno</i>&mdash;the
description of the spot, and all its surroundings&mdash;which
was in the paper that I&mdash;I&mdash;found. Good! It is true!&mdash;ah,
you begin to be interested!&mdash;it is true, all true of the
locality. See! Of the spot I do not know. Of the mine
it has not yet been discovered!</p>

<p>"It is called 'One Horse Gulch;' why&mdash;who knows?
It is a rich mining camp. All around are valuable claims;
but the mine on the top of the little hill is unknown, unclaimed!
For why? You understand, it promises not as
much as the other claims on the surface. It is the same&mdash;all
as described here."</p>

<p>He took from his pocket an envelope, and drew out a
folded paper (the papers given to Grace Conroy by Dr.
Devarges), and pointed to the map.</p>

<p>"The description here leads me to the head waters of the
American River. I followed the range of foot-hills, for I
know every foot, every step, and I came one day last week<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
to 'One Horse Gulch.' See, it is the gulch described here&mdash;all
the same."</p>

<p>He held the paper before her, and her thin, long fingers
closed like a bird's claw over its corners.</p>

<p>"It is necessary I should stay there four or five days to
inquire. And yet how? I am a stranger, a foreigner; the
miners have suspicion of all such, and to me they do not
talk easily. But I hear of one Gabriel Conroy, a good man,
very kind with the sick. Good! I have sickness&mdash;very
sudden, very strong! My rheumatism takes me here."
He pointed to his knee. "I am helpless as a child. I
have to be taken care of at the house of Mr. Briggs. Comes
to me here Gabriel Conroy, sits by me, talks to me, tells me
everything. He brings to me his little sister. I go to his
cabin on the hill. I see the picture of his sister. Good.
You understand? It is all over!"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Eh? She asks why, this woman," said Victor, appealing
to the ceiling. "Is it more you ask? Then listen. The
house of Gabriel Conroy is upon the land, the very land,
you understand? of the grant made by the Governor to Dr.
Devarges. He is this Gabriel, look! he is in possession!"</p>

<p>"How? Does he know of the mine?"</p>

<p>"No! It is accident&mdash;what you call Fate!"</p>

<p>She walked to the window, and stood for a few moments
looking out upon the falling rain. The face that looked out
was so old, so haggard, so hard and set in its outlines, that
one of the loungers on the side-walk, glancing at the window
to catch a glimpse of the pretty French stranger, did not
recognise her. Possibly the incident recalled her to herself,
for she presently turned with a smile of ineffable sweetness,
and returning to the side of Ramirez, said, in the gentlest
of voices, "Then you abandon me?"</p>

<p>Victor did not dare to meet her eyes. He looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
straight before him, shrugged his shoulders, and said&mdash;"It
is Fate!"</p>

<p>She clasped her thin fingers lightly before her, and, standing
in front of her companion, so as to be level with his
eyes, said&mdash;"You have a good memory, Victor."</p>

<p>He did not reply.</p>

<p>"Let me assist it. It is a year ago that I received a letter
in Berlin, signed by a Mr. Peter Dumphy, of San Francisco,
saying that he was in possession of important papers regarding
property of my late husband, Dr. Paul Devarges,
and asking me to communicate with him. I did not answer
his letter; I came. It is not my way to deliberate or hesitate&mdash;perhaps
a wise man would. I am only a poor, weak
woman, so I came. I know it was all wrong. You sharp,
bold, cautious men would have written first. Well, I
came!"</p>

<p>Victor winced slightly, but did not speak.</p>

<p>"I saw Mr. Dumphy in San Francisco. He showed me
some papers that he said he had found in a place of deposit
which Dr. Devarges had evidently wished preserved. One
was a record of a Spanish grant, others indicated some
valuable discoveries. He referred me to the Mission and
Presidio of San Ysabel that had sent out the relief party for
further information. He was a trader&mdash;a mere man of
business&mdash;it was a question of money with him; he agreed
to assist me for a <i>percentage</i>! Is it not so?"</p>

<p>Victor raised his dark eyes to hers, and nodded.</p>

<p>"I came to the Mission. I saw <i>you</i>&mdash;the Secretary of
the former Comandante&mdash;the only one left who remembered
the expedition, and the custodian of the Presidio records.
You showed me the only copy of the report; <i>you</i>, too, would
have been cold and business-like, until I told you my story.
You seemed interested. You told me about the young
girl, this mysterious Grace Conroy, whose name appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
among the dead, who you said you thought was an impostor!
Did you not?"</p>

<p>Victor nodded.</p>

<p>"You told me of her agony on reading the report! Of
her fainting, of the discovery of her condition by the
women, of the Comandante's pity, of her mysterious disappearance,
of the Comandante's reticence, of your own
suspicions of the birth of a child! Did you not, Victor?"</p>

<p>He endeavoured to take her hand. Without altering
her gentle manner, she withdrew her hand quietly, and
went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"And then you told me of your finding that paper on
the floor where they loosened her dress&mdash;the paper you
now hold in your hand. You told me of your reasons for
concealing and withholding it. And then, Victor, you
proposed to me a plan to secure my own again&mdash;to personate
this girl&mdash;to out-imposture this imposture. You did
not ask me for a percentage! You did not seek to make
money out of my needs; you asked only for my love!
Well, well! perhaps I was a fool, a weak woman. It was
a tempting bribe; possibly I listened more to the promptings
of my heart than my interest. I promised you my
hand and my fortune when we succeeded. You come to
me now, and ask to be relieved of that obligation. No!
no! you have said enough."</p>

<p>The now frightened man had seized her by the hand, and
thrown himself on his knees before her in passionate contrition;
but, with a powerful effort, she had wrested herself
free.</p>

<p>"No, no!" she continued, in the same deprecatory
voice. "Go to this brother, whom the chief end of your
labours seems to have been to discover. Go to him now.
Restore to him the paper you hold in your hand. Say that
you stole it from his sister, whom you suspected to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
been an impostor, and that you knew to be the mother of
an illegitimate child! Say that in doing this, you took the
last hope from the wronged and cast-off wife who came
thousands of miles to claim something from the man who
should have supported her. Say this, and that brother, if
he is the good and kind man you represent him to be, he
will rise up and bless you! You have only to tell him
further, that this paper cannot be of any use to him, as
this property legally belongs to his sister's child, if living.
You have only to hand him the report which declares both
of his sisters to be dead, and leaves his own identity in
doubt, to show him what a blessing has fallen upon him."</p>

<p>"Forgive me," gasped Victor, with a painful blending of
shame and awesome admiration of the woman before him;
"forgive me, Julie! I am a coward! a slave! an ingrate!
I will do anything, Julie; anything you say."</p>

<p>Madame Devarges was too sagacious to press her victory
further; perhaps she was too cautious to exasperate the
already incautiously demonstrative man before her. She
said "Hush," and permitted him at the same time, as if
unconsciously, to draw her beside him.</p>

<p>"Listen, Victor. What have you to fear from this man?"
she asked, after a pause. "What would his evidence weigh
against me, when he is in unlawful possession of my property,
my legally declared properly, if I choose to deny his relationship?
Who will identity him as Gabriel Conroy, when his
only surviving relative dare not come forward to recognise
him; when, if she did, you could swear that she came to
you under another name? What would this brother's self-interested
evidence amount to opposed to yours, that I was
the Grace Conroy who came to the Mission, to the proof of
my identity offered by one of the survivors, Peter Dumphy?"</p>

<p>"Dumphy!" echoed Ramirez, in amazement.</p>

<p>"Yes, Dumphy!" repeated Madame Devarges. "When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
he found that, as the divorced wife of Dr. Devarges, I could
make no legal claim, and I told him of your plan, he offered
himself as witness of my identity. Ah, Victor! I have not
been idle while you have found only obstacles."</p>

<p>"Forgive me!" He caught and kissed her hands passionately.
"I fly now. Good-bye."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" she asked, rising.</p>

<p>"To 'One Horse Gulch,'" he answered.</p>

<p>"No! Sit down. Listen. You must go to San Francisco,
and inform Dumphy of your discovery. It will be necessary,
perhaps, to have a lawyer; but we must first see how strong
we stand. You must find out the whereabouts of this girl
Grace, at once. Go to San Francisco, see Dumphy, and
return to me here!"</p>

<p>"But you are alone here, and unprotected. These men!"</p>

<p>The quick suspicions of a jealous nature flashed in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Believe me, they are less dangerous to our plans than
women! Do you not trust me, Victor?" she said, with a
dazzling smile.</p>

<p>He would have thrown himself at her feet, but she
restrained him with an arch look at the wall, and a precautionary
uplifted finger.</p>

<p>"Good; go now. Stay. This Gabriel&mdash;is he married?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Good-bye."</p>

<p>The door closed upon his dark, eager face, and he was
gone. A moment later there was a sharp ringing of the bell
of No. 92, the next room to that occupied by Mme. Devarges.</p>

<p>The truculent porter knocked at the door, and entered
this room respectfully. There was no suspicion attached
to the character of <i>its</i> occupant. <i>He</i> was well known as Mr.
Jack Hamlin, a gambler.</p>

<p>"Why the devil did you keep me waiting?" said Jack,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
reaching from the bed, and wrathfully clutching his boot-jack.</p>

<p>The man murmured some apology.</p>

<p>"Bring me some hot water."</p>

<p>The porter was about to hurriedly withdraw, when Jack
stopped him with an oath.</p>

<p>"You've been long enough coming without shooting off
like that. Who was that man that just left the next room?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir."</p>

<p>"Find out, and let me know."</p>

<p>He flung a gold piece at the man, beat up his pillow, and
turned his face to the wall. The porter still lingered, and
Jack faced sharply round.</p>

<p>"Not gone yet? What the devil"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Beg your pardon, sir; do you know anything about
her?"</p>

<p>"No," said Jack, raising himself on his elbow; "but if
I catch you hanging round that door, as you were five
minutes ago, I'll"&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>Here Mr. Hamlin dropped his voice, and intimated that
he would forcibly dislodge certain vital and necessary organs
from the porter's body.</p>

<p>"Go."</p>

<p>After the door closed again, Mr. Hamlin lay silent for
an hour. At the end of that time he got up and began to
dress himself slowly, singing softly to himself the while, as
was his invariable custom, in that sweet tenor for which he
was famous. When he had thus warbled through his toilet,
replacing a small ivory-handled pistol in his waistcoat-pocket
to one of his most heart-breaking notes, he put his hat on his
handsome head, perhaps a trifle more on one side than
usual, and stepped into the hall. As he sharply shut his
door and locked it, the slight concussion of the thin partitions
caused the door of his fair neighbour's room to start<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
ajar, and Mr. Hamlin, looking up mechanically, saw the
lady standing by the bureau, with her handkerchief to her
eyes. Mr. Hamlin instantly stopped his warbling, and
walked gravely downstairs. At the foot of the steps he met
the porter. The man touched his hat.</p>

<p>"He doesn't belong here, sir."</p>

<p>"Who doesn't belong here?" asked Mr. Hamlin, coldly.</p>

<p>"That man."</p>

<p>"What man?"</p>

<p>"The man you asked about."</p>

<p>Mr. Hamlin quietly took out a cigar, lit it, and after one
or two puffs, looked fixedly in the man's eyes, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I haven't asked you about any man."</p>

<p>"I thought, sir"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You shouldn't begin to drink so early in the day,
Michael," said Mr. Hamlin, quietly, without withdrawing his
black eyes from the man's face. "You can't stand it on an
empty stomach. Take my advice and wait till after dinner."</p>

<h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

<h5>MRS. MARKLE.</h5>


<p>Olly's allusion to Mrs. Markle and her criticism had recurred
to Gabriel more or less uneasily through the night, and as
he rose betimes the next morning and stood by the table on
which lay his handiwork, a grim doubt of his proficiency in
that branch of domestic economy began to oppress him.</p>

<p>"Like as not I ain't doin' my duty to that child," he said
softly to himself, as he picked up the garments one by one,
and deposited them beside the bedside of the still sleeping
Olly. "Them clothes are&mdash;leavin' out the strength and
sayin' nothin' o' durability as material&mdash;a trifle old-fashioned
and onbecomin'. Not as you requires anything o' the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
kind, bless your pooty face," he said, apostrophising the
dewy curls and slumber-flushed cheek of the unconscious
child; "but mebbe it does sorter provoke remarks from
the other children. And the settlement's gettin' crowded.
Three new families in six months is rather too&mdash;too&mdash;&mdash;"
considered Gabriel, hesitating for a word; "rather too
popylating! And Mrs. Markle"&mdash;Gabriel flushed even in
the stillness and solitude of his own cabin&mdash;"to think of
that little gal, not nine years old, speaking o' that widder in
that way. It beats everything. And to think I've kept clar
of that sort o' thing jest on Olly's account, jest that she
shouldn't have any woman around to boss her."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when he and Olly sat down to their frugal
breakfast, he was uneasily conscious of several oddities of
her dress, not before noticeable, and even some peculiarities
of manner.</p>

<p>"Ez a gineral thing, Olly," he pointed out with cautious
generalisation, "ez a gineral thing, in perlite society, young
gals don't sit down a-straddle of their chairs, and don't
reach down every five minnits to heave away at their boot-straps."</p>

<p>"As a general thing, Gabe, girls don't wear boots," said
Olly, leaning forward to dip her bread in the frying-pan.</p>

<p>Artfully evading the question whether high india-rubber
boots were an indispensable feature of a girl's clothing,
Gabriel continued with easy indifference&mdash;"I think I'll
drop in on Mrs. Markle on my way to the Gulch this
morning."</p>

<p>He glanced under his eyelids at as much of his sister's
face as was visible behind the slice of bread she was consuming.</p>

<p>"Take me with you, Gabe?"</p>

<p>"No," said Gabriel, "you must stay here and do up the
house; and mind you keep out o' the woods until your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
work's done. Besides," he added, loftily, "I've got some
business with Mrs. Markle."</p>

<p>"Oh, Gabe!" said Olly, shining all over her face with
gravy and archness.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know what's the matter with you, Olly," said
Gabriel, with dignified composure.</p>

<p>"Ain't you ashamed, Gabe?"</p>

<p>Gabriel did not stop to reply, but rose, gathered up his
tools, and took his hat from the corner. He walked to the
door, but suddenly turned and came back to Olly.</p>

<p>"Olly," he said, taking her face in both hands, after his
old fashion, "ef anything at any time should happen to me,
I want ye to think, my darling, ez I always did my best for
you, Olly, for you. Wotever I did was always for the best."</p>

<p>Olly thought instantly of the river.</p>

<p>"You ain't goin' into deep water to-day, Gabe, are you?"
she asked, with a slight premonitory quiver of her short
upper lip.</p>

<p>"Pooty deep for me, Olly; but," he added, hastily, with a
glance at her alarmed face, "don't you mind, I'll come out
all safe. Good-bye." He kissed her tenderly. She ran
her fingers through his sandy curls, deftly smoothed his
beard, and reknotted his neckerchief.</p>

<p>"You oughter hev put on your other shirt, Gabe; that
ain't clean; and you a-goin' to Mrs. Markle's! Let me get
your straw hat, Gabe. Wait." She ran in behind the
screen, but when she returned he was gone.</p>

<p>It had been raining the night before, but on the earth
beneath there was a dewy freshness, and in the sky above
the beauty of cloud scenery&mdash;a beauty rare to California
except during the rainy season. Gabriel, although not
usually affected by meteorological influences, nor peculiarly
susceptible to the charms of Nature, felt that the morning
was a fine one, and was for that reason, I imagine, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
than usually accessible to the blandishments of the fair.
From admiring a tree, a flower, or a gleam of sunshine, to
the entertainment of a dangerous sentimentalism in regard
to the other sex, is, I fear, but a facile step to some natures,
whose only safety is in continuous practicality. Wherefore,
Gabriel, as he approached the cottage of Mrs. Markle, was
induced to look from Nature up to&mdash;Nature's goddess&mdash;Mrs.
Markle, as her strong bright face appeared above the
dishes she was washing by the kitchen window. And here
occurred one of those feminine inconsistencies that are
charming to the average man, but are occasionally
inefficient with an exceptional character. Mrs. Markle,
who had always been exceedingly genial, gentle, and natural
with Gabriel during his shyness, seeing him coming with
a certain fell intent of cheerfulness in his face, instantly
assumed an aggressive manner, which, for the sake of its
probable warning to the rest of her sex, I venture to
transcribe.</p>

<p>"Ef you want to see me, Gabriel Conroy," said Mrs.
Markle, stopping to wipe the suds from her brown but
handsomely shaped arms, "you must come up to the sink,
for I can't leave the dishes. Joe Markle always used to say
to me, 'Sue, when you've got work to do, you don't let
your mind wander round much on anything else.' Sal,
bring a cheer here for Gabriel&mdash;he don't come often enough
to stand up for a change. We're hard-working women, you
and me, Sal, and we don't get time to be sick&mdash;and sick
folks is about the only kind as Mr. Conroy cares to see."</p>

<p>Thoroughly astonished as Gabriel was with this sarcastic
reception, there was still a certain relief that it brought to him.
"Olly was wrong," he said to himself; "that woman only
thinks of washing dishes and lookin' after her boarders. Ef
she was allus like this&mdash;and would leave a man alone, never
foolin' around him, but kinder standin' off and 'tendin' strictly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
to the business of the house, why, it wouldn't be such a bad
thing to marry her. But like as not she'd change&mdash;you
can't trust them critters. Howsomever I can set Olly's mind
at rest."</p>

<p>Happily unconscious of the heresies that were being
entertained by the silent man before her, Mrs. Markle
briskly continued her washing and her monologue, occasionally
sprinkling Gabriel with the overflow of each.</p>

<p>"When I say hard-workin' women, Sal," said Mrs. Markle,
still addressing a gaunt female companion, whose sole functions
were confined to chuckling at Gabriel over the dishes
she was wiping, and standing with her back to her mistress&mdash;"when
I say hard-workin' women, Sal, I don't forget ez
there are men ez is capable of doin' all that, and more&mdash;men
ez looks down on you and me." Here Mistress Markle
broke a plate, and then, after a pause, sighed, faced around
with a little colour in her cheek and a sharp snap in her
black eyes, and declared that she was "that narvous" this
morning that she couldn't go on.</p>

<p>There was an embarrassing silence. Luckily for Gabriel,
at this moment the gaunt Sal picked up the dropped thread
of conversation, and with her back to her mistress, and profoundly
ignoring his presence, addressed herself to the
wall.</p>

<p>"Narvous you well may be, Susan, and you slavin' for
forty boarders, with transitory meals for travellers, and
nobody to help you. If you was flat on your back with
rheumatiz, ez you well might be, perhaps you might get a
hand. A death in the family might be of sarvice to you in
callin' round you friends az couldn't otherwise leave their
business. That cough that little Manty had on to her for
the last five weeks would frighten some mothers into a
narvous consumption."</p>

<p>Gabriel at this moment had a vivid and guilty recollection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
of noticing Manty Markle wading in the ditch below the
house as he entered, and of having observed her with the
interest of possible paternal relationship. That relationship
seemed so preposterous and indefensible on all moral grounds,
now that he began to feel himself in the light of an impostor,
and was proportionally embarrassed. His confusion was
shown in a manner peculiarly characteristic of himself.
Drawing a small pocket comb from his pocket, he began
combing out his sandy curls, softly, with a perplexed smile
on his face. The widow had often noticed this action,
divined its cause, and accepted it as a tribute. She began
to relent. By some occult feminine sympathy, this relenting
was indicated by the other woman.</p>

<p>"You're out of sorts this morning, Susan, 'nd if ye'll take
a fool's advice, ye'll jest quit work, and make yourself comfortable
in the settin'-room, and kinder pass the time o' day
with Gabriel; onless he's after waitin' to pick up some hints
about housework. I never could work with a man around.
I'll do up the dishes ef you'll excuse my kempany, which
two is and three's none. Yer give me this apron. You
don't hev time, I declare, Sue, to tidy yourself up. And
your hair's comin' down."</p>

<p>The gaunt Sal, having recognised Gabriel's presence to
this extent, attempted to reorganise Mrs. Markle's coiffure,
but was playfully put aside by that lady, with the remark,
that "she had too much to do to think of them things."</p>

<p>"And it's only a mop, anyway," she added, with severe
self-depreciation; "let it alone, will you, Sal! Thar! I
told you; now you've done it." And she had. The infamous
Sal, by some deft trick well known to her deceitful
sex, had suddenly tumbled the whole wealth of Mrs. Markle's
black mane over her plump shoulders. Mrs. Markle, with
a laugh, would have flown to the chaste recesses of the
sitting-room; but Sal, like a true artist, restrained her, until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
the full effect of this poetic picture should be impressed
upon the unsuspecting Gabriel's memory.</p>

<p>"Mop, indeed!" said Sal. "It's well that many folks is
of many minds, and self-praise is open disgrace; but when
a man like Lawyer Maxwell sez to me only yesterday sittin'
at this very table, lookin' kinder up at you, Sue, as you was
passin' soup, unconscious like, and one o' 'em braids droppin'
down, and jest missin' the plate, when Lawyer Maxwell
sez to me, 'Sal, thar's many a fine lady in Frisco ez would
give her pile to have Susan Markle's hair'"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But here Sal was interrupted by the bashful escape of
Mrs. Markle to the sitting-room. "Ye don't know whether
Lawyer Maxwell has any bisness up this way, Gabriel, do
ye?" said Sal, resuming her work.</p>

<p>"No," said the unconscious Gabriel, happily as oblivious
of the artful drift of the question as he had been of the
dangerous suggestiveness of Mrs. Markle's hair.</p>

<p>"Because he <i>does</i> kinder pass here more frequent than he
used, and hez taken ez menny ez five meals in one day. I
declare, I thought that was him when you kem just now!
I don't think thet Sue notices it, not keering much for that
kind of build in a man," continued Sal, glancing at Gabriel's
passively powerful shoulders, and the placid strength of his
long limbs. "How do you think Sue's looking now&mdash;ez a
friend interested in the family&mdash;how does she look to you?"</p>

<p>Gabriel hastened to assure Sal of the healthful appearance
of Mrs. Markle, but only extracted from his gaunt
companion a long sigh and a shake of the head.</p>

<p>"It's deceitful, Gabriel! No one knows what that poor
critter goes through. Her mind's kinder onsettled o' late,
and in that onsettled state, she breaks things. You see her
break that plate just now? Well, perhaps I oughtn't to say
it&mdash;but you being a friend and in confidence, for she'd kill
me, being a proud kind o' nater, suthin' like my own, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
it may not amount to nothin' arter all&mdash;but I kin always tell
when you've been around by the breakages. You was here,
let's see, the week afore last, and there wasn't cups enough
left to go round that night for supper!"</p>

<p>"Maybe it's chills," said the horror-stricken Gabriel, his
worst fears realised, rising from his chair; "I've got some
Indian cholagogue over to the cabin, and I'll jest run over
and get it, or send it back." Intent only upon retreat, he
would have shamelessly flown; but Sal intercepted him with
a face of mysterious awe.</p>

<p>"Ef she should kem in here and find you gone, Gabriel,
in that weak state of hers&mdash;narvous you may call it, but so
it is&mdash;I wouldn't be answerable for that poor critter's life.
Ef she should think you'd gone, arter what has happened,
arter what has passed between you and her to-day, it would
jest kill her."</p>

<p>"But what has passed?" said Gabriel, in vague alarm.</p>

<p>"It ain't for me," said the gaunt Sal, loftily, "to pass my
opinion on other folks' conduct, or to let on what this means,
or what thet means, or to give my say about people callin' on
other people, and broken crockery, hair combs"&mdash;Gabriel
winced&mdash;"and people ez is too nice and keerful to open
their mouths afore folks! It ain't for me to get up and say
that, when a woman is ever so little out of sorts, and a man
is so far gone ez he allows to rush off like a madman to get
her medicines, what ez or what ezn't in it. I keep my own
counsel, and thet's my way. Many's the time Sue hez said
to me: 'Ef thar ever was a woman ez knowed how to lock
herself up and throw away the key, it's you, Sal.' And
there you are, ma'am, and it's high time ez plain help like
me stopped talkin' while ladies and gentlemen exchanged
the time o' day."</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that the latter part of this
speech was addressed to the widow, who at that moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
appeared at the door of the sitting-room, in a new calico
gown that showed her plump figure to advantage, or that
the gaunt Sal intended to indicate the serious character of
the performance by a show of increased respect to the
actors.</p>

<p>"I hope I ain't intrudin' on your conversation," said the
widow, archly, stopping, with a show of consideration, on
the threshold. "Ef you and Sal ain't done private matters
yet&mdash;I'll wait."</p>

<p>"I don't think ez Gabriel hez anything more to say
thet you shouldn't hear, Mrs. Markle," said Sal, strongly
implying a recent confidential disclosure from Gabriel,
which delicacy to Gabriel alone prevented her from giving.
"But it ain't for me to hear confidence in matters of the
feelin's."</p>

<p>It is difficult to say whether Mrs. Markle's archness, or
Sal's woeful perspicuity, was most alarming to Gabriel. He
rose; he would have flown, even with the terrible contingency
of Mrs. Markle's hysterics before his eyes; he would
have faced even that forcible opposition from Sal of which he
fully believed her capable, but that a dreadful suspicion that
he was already hopelessly involved, that something would
yet transpire that would enable him to explain himself, and
perhaps an awful fascination of his very danger, turned his
irresolute feet into Mrs. Markle's sitting-room. Mrs. Markle
offered him a chair; he sank helplessly into it, while, from
the other room, Sal, violently clattering her dishes, burst
into shrill song, so palpably done for the purpose of assuring
the bashful couple of her inability to overhear their tender
confidences, that Gabriel coloured to the roots of his hair.</p>

<p>That evening Gabriel returned from his work in the
gulch more than usually grave. To Olly's inquiries
he replied shortly and evasively. It was not, however,
Gabriel's custom to remain uncommunicative on even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
disagreeable topics, and Olly bided her time. It came
after their frugal supper was over&mdash;which, unlike the
morning meal, passed without any fastidious criticism on
Gabriel's part&mdash;and Olly had drawn a small box, her
favourite seat, between her brother's legs, and rested the
back of her head comfortably against his waistcoat. When
Gabriel had lighted his pipe at the solitary candle, he gave
one or two preliminary puffs, and then, taking his pipe
from his mouth, said gently, "Olly, it can't be done."</p>

<p>"What can't be done, Gabe?" queried the artful Olly,
with a swift preconception of the answer, expanding her
little mouth into a thoughtful smile.</p>

<p>"Thet thing."&mdash;"What thing, Gabe?"</p>

<p>"This yer marryin' o' Mrs. Markle," said Gabriel, with
an assumption of easy, business-like indifference.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Olly.</p>

<p>"She wouldn't hev me."</p>

<p>"What?" said Olly, facing swiftly round.</p>

<p>Gabriel evaded his sister's eyes, and looking in the fire,
repeated slowly, but with great firmness&mdash;</p>

<p>"No; not fur&mdash;fur&mdash;fur a gift!"</p>

<p>"She's a mean, stuck-up, horrid old thing!" said Olly,
fiercely. "I'd jest like to&mdash;why, there ain't a man az kin
compare with you, Gabe! Like her impudence!"</p>

<p>Gabriel waved his pipe in the air deprecatingly, yet
with such an evident air of cheerful resignation, that Olly
faced upon him again suspiciously, and asked&mdash;"What
did she say?"</p>

<p>"She said," replied Gabe, slowly, "thet her heart was
given to another. I think she struck into poetry, and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>
"'My heart it is another's,<br />
And it never can be thine.<br />
</p>

<p>"Thet is, I think so. I disremember her special remark,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Olly; but you know women allers spout poetry at sech
times. Ennyhow, that's about the way the spring panned
out."</p>

<p>"Who was it?" said Olly, suddenly.</p>

<p>"She didn't let on who," said Gabriel, uneasily. "I
didn't think it the square thing to inquire."</p>

<p>"Well," said Olly.</p>

<p>Gabriel looked down still more embarrassed, and shifted
his position. "Well," he repeated.</p>

<p>"What did <i>you</i> say?" said Olly.&mdash;"Then?"</p>

<p>"No, afore. How did you do it, Gabe?" said Olly,
comfortably fixing her chin in her hands, and looking up
in her brother's face.</p>

<p>"Oh, the usual way!" said Gabriel, with a motion of his
pipe, to indicate vague and glittering generalities of courtship.</p>

<p>"But how? Gabe, tell me all about it."</p>

<p>"Well," said Gabriel, looking up at the roof, "wimmen
is bashful ez a general thing, and thar's about only one way
ez a man can get at 'em, and that ez, by being kinder keerless
and bold. Ye see, Olly, when I kem inter the house,
I sorter jest chucked Sal under the chin&mdash;thet way, you
know&mdash;and then went up and put my arm around the
widder's waist, and kissed her two or three times, you know,
jest to be sociable and familiar like."</p>

<p>"And to think, Gabe, thet after all that she wouldn't
hev ye," said Olly.</p>

<p>"Not at any price," said Gabriel, positively.</p>

<p>"The disgustin' creature!" said Olly, "I'd jest like to
ketch that Manty hangin' round yer after that!" she continued,
savagely, with a vicious shake of her little fist.
"And just to think, only to-day we give her her pick o'
them pups!"</p>

<p>"Hush, Olly, ye mustn't do anythin' o' the sort," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Gabriel, hastily. "Ye must never let on to any one anything.
It's confidence, Olly, confidence, ez these sort o'
things allus is&mdash;atween you and me. Besides," he went on,
reassuringly, "that's nothin'. Lord, afore a man's married
he hez to go through this kind o' thing a dozen times. It's
expected. There was a man as I once knowed," continued
Gabriel, with shameless mendacity, "ez went through it
fifty tunes, and he was a better man nor me, and could
shake a thousand dollars in the face of any woman. Why,
bless your eyes, Olly, some men jest likes it&mdash;it's excitement&mdash;like
perspectin'."</p>

<p>"But what did you say, Gabe?" said Olly, returning
with fresh curiosity to the central fact, and ignoring the
Pleasures of Rejection as expounded by Gabriel.</p>

<p>"Well, I just up, and sez this: Susan Markle, sez I, the
case is just this. Here's Olly and me up there on the hill,
and jess you and Manty down there on the Gulch, and
mountings wild and valleys deep two loving hearts do now
divide, and there's no reason why it shouldn't be one family
and one house, and that family and that house mine. And
it's for you to say when. And then I kinder slung in a
little more poetry, and sorter fooled around with that ring,"
said Gabriel, showing a heavy plain gold ring on his powerful
little finger, "and jest kissed her agin, and chucked
Sally under the chin, and that's all."</p>

<p>"And she wouldn't hev ye, Gabe," said Olly, thoughtfully,
"after all that? Well, who wants her to? I don't."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear you say that, Olly," said Gabriel.
"But ye mustn't let on a word of it to her. She talks o'
coming up on the hill to build, and wants to buy that part
of the old claim where I perspected last summer, so's to be
near us, and look arter you. And, Olly," continued Gabriel,
gravely, "ef she comes round yer foolin' around me ez she
used to do, ye mustn't mind that&mdash;it's women's ways."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'd like to catch her at it," said Olly.</p>

<p>Gabriel looked at Olly with a guilty satisfaction, and
drew her toward him. "And now that it's all over, Olly,"
said he, "it's all the better ez it is. You and me'll get
along together ez comfortable as we kin. I talked with
some of the boys the other day about sendin' for a schoolmarm
from Marysville, and Mrs. Markle thinks it's a good
idee. And you'll go to school, Olly. I'll run up to Marysville
next week and get you some better clothes, and we'll
be just ez happy ez ever. And then some day, Olly, afore
you know it&mdash;them things come always suddent&mdash;I'll jest
make a strike outer that ledge, and we'll be rich. Thar's
money in that ledge, Olly, I've allus allowed that. And
then we'll go&mdash;you and me&mdash;to San Francisco, and we'll
hev a big house, and I'll jest invite a lot of little girls, the
best they is in Frisco, to play with you, and you'll hev all
the teachers you want, and women ez will be glad to look
arter ye. And then maybe I might make it up with Mrs.
Markle"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Never!" said Olly, passionately.</p>

<p>"Never it is!" said the artful Gabriel, with a glow of
pleasure in his eyes, and a slight stirring of remorse in
his breast. "But it's time that small gals like you was
abed."</p>

<p>Thus admonished, Olly retired behind the screen, taking
the solitary candle, and leaving her brother smoking his
pipe by the light of the slowly dying fire. But Olly did
not go to sleep, and half an hour later, peering out of the
screen, she saw her brother still sitting by the fire, his pipe
extinguished, and his head resting on his hand. She went
up to him so softly that she startled him, shaking a drop of
water on the hand that she suddenly threw round his
neck.</p>

<p>"You ain't worrying about that woman, Gabe?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," said Gabriel, with a laugh.</p>

<p>Olly looked down at her hand. Gabriel looked up at
the roof. "There's a leak thar that's got to be stopped to-morrow.
Go to bed, Olly, or you'll take your death."</p>

<h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>

<h5>IN WHICH THE ARTFUL GABRIEL IS DISCOVERED.</h5>


<p>Notwithstanding his assumed ease and a certain relief,
which was real, Gabriel was far from being satisfied with
the result of his visit to Mrs. Markle. Whatever may have
actually occurred, not known to the reader except through
Gabriel's own disclosure to Olly, Gabriel's manner hardly
bore out the boldness and conclusiveness of his statement.
For a day or two afterwards he resented any allusion to the
subject from Olly, but on the third day he held a conversation
with one of the Eureka Bar miners, which seemed to
bear some remote reference to his experience.</p>

<p>"Thar's a good deal said lately in the papers," began
Gabriel, cautiously, "in regard to breach o' promise trials.
Lookin' at it, by and large, thar don't seem to be much
show for a fellow ez hez been in enny ways kind to a gal,
is thar?"</p>

<p>The person addressed, whom rumour declared to have
sought One Horse Gulch as a place of refuge from his wife,
remarked with an oath that women were blank fools anyway,
and that on general principles they were not to be trusted.</p>

<p>"But thar must be a kind o' gin'ral law on the subject,"
urged Gabriel. "Now what would be your opinion if you
was on a jury onto a case like this? It happened to a
friend o' mine in Frisco," said Gabriel, with a marked
parenthesis, "a man ez you don't know. Thar was a woman&mdash;we'll
say a widder&mdash;ez had been kinder hangin' round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
him off and on for two or three year, and he hadn't allowed
anything to her about marryin'. One day he goes down thar
to her house, kinder easy-like, jest to pass the time o' day,
and be sociable"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's bad," interrupted the cynic.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Gabriel, doubtingly, "p'r'aps it does look bad,
but you see he didn't mean anythin'."</p>

<p>"Well?" said the adviser.</p>

<p>"Well! thet's all," said Gabriel.</p>

<p>"All!" exclaimed his companion, indignantly.</p>

<p>"Yes, all. Now this woman kinder allows she'll bring a
suit agin him to make him marry her."</p>

<p>"My opinion is," said the adviser, bluntly, "my opinion
is, that the man was a fool, and didn't tell ye the truth
nuther, and I'd give damages agin him, for being such a
fool."</p>

<p>This opinion was so crushing to Gabriel that he turned
hopelessly away. Nevertheless, in his present state of mind,
he could not refrain from pushing his inquiries further, and
in a general conversation which took place at Briggs's store,
in the afternoon, among a group of smokers, Gabriel artfully
introduced the subject of courtship and marriage.</p>

<p>"Thar's different ways of getting at the feelin's of a
woman," said the oracular Johnson, after a graphic statement
of his own method of ensnaring the affections of a former
sweetheart, "thar's different ways jest as thar's different men
and women in the world. One man's way won't do with
some wimmen. But thar's one way ez is pretty sure to fetch
'em allers. That is, to play off indifferent&mdash;to never let on
ye like 'em! To kinder look arter them in a gin'ral sort
o' way, pretty much as Gabe thar looks arter the sick!&mdash;but
not to say anythin' particler. To make them understand
that they've got to do all the courtin', ef thar's enny to be
done. What's the matter, Gabe, ye ain't goin'?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>Gabriel, who had risen in great uneasiness, muttered
something about "its being time to go home," and then sat
down again, looking at Johnson in fearful fascination.</p>

<p>"That kind o' thing is pretty sure to fetch almost enny
woman," continued Johnson, "and a man ez does it orter
be looked arter. It orter be put down by law. It's
tamperin', don't yer see, with the holiest affections. Sich
a man orter be spotted wharever found."</p>

<p>"But mebbe the man don't mean anythin'&mdash;mebbe it's
jest his way," suggested Gabriel, ruefully, looking around
in the faces of the party, "mebbe he don't take to wimmen
and marriage nat'ral, and it's jest his way."</p>

<p>"Way be blowed!" said the irate Johnson, scornfully.
"Ketch him, indeed! It's jest the artfullest kind o' artfulness.
It's jest begging on a full hand."</p>

<p>Gabriel rose slowly, and, resisting any further attempts to
detain him, walked to the door, and, after a remark on the
threatening nature of the weather, delivered in a manner
calculated to impress his audience with his general indifference
to the subject then under discussion, melted dejectedly
away into the driving rain that had all day swept over
One Horse Gulch, and converted its one long narrow street
into a ditch of turbulent yellow water.</p>

<p>"Thet Gabe seems to be out o' sorts to-day," said Johnson.
"I heerd Lawyer Maxwell asking arter him this morning;
I reckon thar's suthin' up! Gabe ain't a bad sort of chap.
Hezen't got enny too much <i>sabe</i> about him, but he's mighty
good at looking arter sick folks, and thet kind o' man's a
power o' use in this camp. Hope thar ain't anything ez will
interfere with his sphere o' usefulness."</p>

<p>"May be a woman scrape," suggested Briggs. "He
seemed sort o' bound up in what you was saying about
women jest now. Thar is folks round yer," said Briggs,
dropping his voice and looking about him, "ez believes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
that that yer Olly, which he lets on to be his sister, to be
actooally his own child. No man would tote round a child
like that, and jest bind himself up in her, and give up
wimmen and whisky, and keerds, and kempeny, ef it wasn't
his own. Thet ain't like brothers in my part of the
country."</p>

<p>"It's a mighty queer story he tells, ennyways&mdash;all this
yer stuff about Starvation Camp and escapin'," suggested
another. "I never did, somehow, take enny stock in that."</p>

<p>"Well, it's his own look out," concluded Johnson. "It's
nothin' to me. Ef I've been any service to him pintin' out
sick people, and kinder makin' suggestions here and thar,
how he should look arter them, he's welcome to it. I don't
go back on my record, if he hez got into trouble."</p>

<p>"And I'm sure," said Briggs, "if I did allow him to
come in here and look arter thet sick Mexican, it ain't for
me to be expected to look after his moril character too."
But here the entrance of a customer put a stop to further
criticism.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the unfortunate subject of this discussion, by
clinging close to the walls of houses, had avoided the keen
blast that descended from the mountain, and had at last
reached the little trail that led through the gulch to his
cabin on the opposite hill-side. Here Gabriel hesitated.
To follow that trail would lead him past the boarding-house
of Mrs. Markle. In the light of the baleful counsel he had
just received, to place himself as soon again in the way of
danger seemed to him to be only a provocation of fate.
That the widow and Sal might swoop down upon him as he
passed, and compel him to enter; that the spectacle of his
passing without a visit might superinduce instant hysterics
on the part of the widow, appeared to his terror-stricken
fancy as almost a certainty. The only other way home was
by a circuitous road along the ridge of the hill, at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
three miles farther. Gabriel did not hesitate long, but
began promptly to ascend the hill. This was no easy task
in the face of a strong gale and torrents of beating rain, but
the overcoming of physical difficulties by the exercise of
his all conquering muscles, and the fact that he was doing
something, relieved his mind of its absurd terrors. When he
had reached the summit he noticed for the first time the full
power of those subtle agencies that had been silently at work
during the last week's steady rain. A thin trickling mountain
rill where he had two weeks before slaked his thirst
during a ramble with Olly, was now transformed into a roaring
cataract; the brook that they had leaped across was now
a swollen river. There were slowly widening pools in the
valleys, darkly glancing sheets of water on the distant plains,
and a monotonous rush and gurgle always in the air. It was
half an hour later, and two miles farther on his rough road,
that he came in view of the narrow precipitous gorge through
which the Wingdam stage passed on its way from Marysville.
As he approached nearer he could see that the little mountain
stream which ran beside the stage road had already slightly
encroached upon the road-bed, and that here and there the
stage road itself was lost in drifts of standing water. "It
will be pretty rough drivin' up that cañon," said Gabriel to
himself as he thought of the incoming Wingdam stage, now
nearly due; "mighty onpleasant and risky with narvous
leaders, but thar's worse things than that in this yer world,"
he meditated, as his mind reverted again to Mrs. Markle,
"and ef I could change places with Yuba Bill, and get on
that box and Olly inside&mdash;I'd do it!"</p>

<p>But just then the reservoir of the Wingdam ditch came
in view on the hill beside him, and with it a revelation that
in a twinkling displaced Mrs. Markle, and seemed almost
to change the man's entire nature! What was it? Apparently
nothing to the eye of the ordinary traveller. The dam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
was full, and through a cut-off the overplus water was escaping
with a roar. Nothing more? Yes&mdash;to an experienced
eye the escaping water was not abating the quantity in the
dam. Was that all? No! Halfway down the rudely constructed
<i>adobe</i> bank of the dam, the water was slowly oozing
and trickling through a slowly-widening crevice, over
the rocks above the gorge and stage road below! The wall
of the dam was giving way! To tear off coat and all impeding
garments, to leap from rock to rock, and boulder to
boulder, hanging on by slippery chimisal and the decayed
roots of trees; to reach at the risk of life and limb the
cañon below, and then to run at the highest speed to warn
the incoming stage of the danger before it should enter the
narrow gorge, was only the resolve and action of a brave
man. But to do this without the smallest waste of strength
that ought to be preserved, to do this with the greatest
economy of force, to do this with the agility and skill of a
mountaineer, and the reserved power of a giant; to do this
with a will so simple, direct, and unhesitating, that the
action appeared to have been planned and rehearsed days
before, instead of being the resolution of the instant,&mdash;this
belonged to Gabriel Conroy! And to have seen him settle
into a long swinging trot, and to have observed his calm,
grave, earnest, but unexcited face, and quiet, steadfast eye,
you would have believed him some healthy giant simply
exercising himself.</p>

<p>He had not gone half a mile before his quick ear caught
a dull sound and roar of advancing water. Yet even then
he only slightly increased his steady stride, as if he had
been quickened and followed by his trainer rather than by
approaching Death. At the same moment there was a quick
rattle and clatter in the road ahead&mdash;a halt, and turning
back, for Gabriel's warning shout had run before him like
a bullet. But it was too late. The roaring water behind him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
struck him and bore him down, and the next instant swept
the coach and horses a confused, struggling, black mass,
against the rocky walls of the cañon. And then it was that
the immense reserved strength of Gabriel came into play.
Set upon by the almost irresistible volume of water, he did
not waste his power in useless opposition, but allowed himself
to be swept hither and thither until he touched a
branch of chimisal that depended from the cañon side.
Seizing it with one sudden and mighty effort, he raised himself
above the sweep and suction of the boiling flood. The
coach was gone; where it had stood a few black figures
struggled, swirled, and circled. One of them was a woman.
In an instant Gabriel plunged into the yellow water. A few
strokes brought him to her side; in another moment he
had encircled her waist with his powerful arm and lifted her
head above the surface, when he was seized by two despairing
arms from the other side. Gabriel did not shake
them off. "Take hold of me lower down and I'll help ye
both," he shouted, as he struck out with his only free arm
for the chimisal. He reached it; drew himself up so that he
could grasp it with his teeth, and then, hanging on by his jaw,
raised his two clinging companions beside him. They had
barely grasped it, when another ominous roar was heard below,
and another wall of yellow water swept swiftly up the cañon.
The chimisal began to yield to their weight. Gabriel dug
his fingers into the soil about its roots, clutched the jagged
edges of a rock beneath, and threw his arm about the
woman, pressing her closely to the face of the wall. As the
wave swept over them, there was a sudden despairing cry, a
splash, and the man was gone. Only Gabriel and the woman
remained. They were safe, but for the moment only.
Gabriel's left hand grasping an insecure projection, was all
that sustained their united weight. Gabriel, for the first time,
looked down upon the woman. Then he said hesitatingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Kin ye hold yourself a minnit?"&mdash;"Yes."</p>

<p>Even at that critical moment some occult quality of
sweetness in her voice thrilled him.</p>

<p>"Lock your hands together hard, and sling 'em over my
neck." She did so. Gabriel freed his right hand. He
scarcely felt the weight thus suddenly thrown upon his
shoulders, but cautiously groped for a projection on the
rock above. He found it, raised himself by a supreme
effort, until he secured a foothold in the hole left by the
uprooted chimisal bush. Here he paused.</p>

<p>"Kin ye hang on a minnit longer?"</p>

<p>"Go on," she said.</p>

<p>Gabriel went on. He found another projection, and
another, and gradually at last reached a ledge a foot wide,
near the top of the cliff. Here he paused. It was the
woman's turn to speak.</p>

<p>"Can you climb to the top?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;if you"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go on," she said, simply.</p>

<p>Gabriel continued the ascent cautiously. In a few
minutes he had reached the top. Here her hands suddenly
relaxed their grasp; she would have slipped to the ground
had not Gabriel caught her by the waist, lifted her in his
arms, and borne her to a spot where a fallen pine-tree had
carpeted and cushioned the damp ground with its withered
tassels. Here he laid her down with that exquisite delicacy
and tenderness of touch which was so habitual to him in his
treatment of all helplessness as to be almost unconscious.
But she thanked him, with such a graceful revelation of
small white teeth, and such a singular look out of her dark
grey eyes, that he could not help looking at her again. She
was a small light-haired woman, tastefully and neatly dressed,
and of a type and class unknown to him. But for her smile,
he would not have thought her pretty. But even with that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
smile on her face, she presently paled and fainted. At the
same moment Gabriel heard the sound of voices, and,
looking up, saw two of the passengers, who had evidently
escaped by climbing the cliff, coming towards them. And
then&mdash;I know not how to tell it&mdash;but a sudden and awe-inspiring
sense of his ambiguous and peculiar situation took
possession of him. What would they think of it? Would
they believe his statement? A sickening recollection of the
late conversation at Brigg's returned to him; the indignant
faces of the gaunt Sal and the plump Mrs. Markle were before
him; even the questioning eyes of little Olly seemed to
pierce his inmost soul, and alas! this hero, the victorious
giant, turned and fled.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER V.</h4>

<h5>SIMPLICITY <i>versus</i> SAGACITY.</h5>


<p>When Gabriel reached his home it was after dark, and Olly
was anxiously waiting to receive him.</p>

<p>"You're wet all through, you awful Gabe, and covered
with mud into the bargain. Go and change your clothes,
or you'll get your death, as sure as you're a born sinner!"</p>

<p>The tone and manner in which this was uttered was something
unusual with Olly, but Gabriel was too glad to escape
further questioning to criticise or rebuke it. But when he
had reappeared from behind the screen with dry clothes, he
was surprised to observe by the light of the newly-lit candle
that Olly herself had undergone since morning a decided
change in her external appearance. Not to speak alone of an
unusual cleanliness of face and hands, and a certain attempt
at confining her yellow curls with a vivid pink ribbon, there
was an unwonted neatness in her attire, and some essay
at adornment in a faded thread-lace collar which she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
found among her mother's "things" in the family bag, and
a purple neck-ribbon.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said the delighted Gabriel, "that somebody
else hez been dressin' up and makin' a toylit, sence
I've been away. Hev you been in the ditches agin, Olly?"</p>

<p>"No," said Olly, with some dignity of manner, as she
busied herself in setting the table for supper.</p>

<p>"But I reckon I never seen ye look so peart afore, Olly;
who's been here?" he added, with a sudden alarm.</p>

<p>"Nobody," said Olly; "I reckon some folks kin get
along and look decent without the help of other folks, leastways
of Susan Markle."</p>

<p>At this barbed arrow Gabriel winced slightly. "See yer,
Olly," said Gabriel, "ye mustn't talk thet way about thet
woman. You're only a chile&mdash;and ef yer brother did let on
to ye, in confidence, certing things ez a brother may say to
his sister, ye oughtn't say anythin' about it."</p>

<p>"Say anythin'!" echoed Olly, scornfully; "do you think
I'd ever let on to thet woman ennything? Ketch me!"</p>

<p>Gabriel looked up at his sister in awful admiration, and
felt at the depths of his conscience-stricken and self-deprecatory
nature that he didn't deserve so brave a little defender.
For a moment he resolved to tell her the truth, but a fear of
Olly's scorn and a desire to bask in the sunshine of her
active sympathy withheld him. "Besides," he added to
himself, in a single flash of self-satisfaction, "this yer thing
may be the makin' o' thet gal yet. Look at thet collar,
Gabriel! look at thet hair, Gabriel! all your truth-tellin'
never fetched outer thet purty child what thet one yarn
did."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as Gabriel sat down to his supper he was
still haunted by the ominous advice and counsel he had
heard that day. When Olly had finished her meal, he
noticed that she had forborne, evidently at great personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
sacrifice, to sop the frying-pan with her bread. He turned
to her gravely&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ef you wus ever asked, Olly, ef I had been sweet upon
Mrs. Markle, wot would ye say?"</p>

<p>"Say," said Olly savagely, "I'd say that if there ever
was a woman ez had run arter a man with less call to do
it&mdash;it was Mrs. Markle&mdash;that same old disgustin' Susan
Markle. Thet's wot I'd say, and I'd say it&mdash;to her face!
Gabe, see here!"</p>

<p>"Well," said the delighted Gabriel.</p>

<p>"Ef that school-ma'am comes up here, do you jest make
up to her!"</p>

<p>"Olly!" ejaculated the alarmed Gabriel.</p>

<p>"You jest go for her! You jest do for her what you did
for that Susan Markle. And jest you do it, if you can,
Gabe&mdash;when Mrs. Markle's around&mdash;or afore little Manty&mdash;she'll
go and tell her mother&mdash;she tells her everything. I've
heerd, Gabe, that some o' them school-ma'ams is nice."</p>

<p>In his desire to please Olly, Gabriel would have imparted
to her the story of his adventure in the cañon, but a vague
fear that Olly might demand from him an instant offer of
his hand and heart to the woman he had saved, checked
the disclosure. And the next moment there was a rap at
the door of the cabin.</p>

<p>"I forgot to say, Gabe, that Lawyer Maxwell was here
to-day to see ye," said Olly, "and I bet you thet's him. If
he wants you to nuss anybody, Gabe, don't ye do it! You
got enough to do to look arter me!"</p>

<p>Gabriel rose with a perplexed face and opened the door.
A tall dark man, with a beard heavily streaked with grey,
entered. There was something in his manner and dress,
although both conformed to local prejudices and customs,
that denoted a type of man a little above the average social
condition of One Horse Gulch. Unlike Gabriel's previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
evening visitor, he did not glance around him, but fixed
a pair of keen, half-humorous, half-interrogating grey eyes
upon his host's face, and kept them there. The habitual
expression of his features was serious, except for a certain
half-nervous twitching at the left corner of his mouth, which
continued usually, until he stopped and passed his hand softly
across it. The impression always left on the spectator was,
that he had wiped away a smile, as some people do a tear.</p>

<p>"I don't think I ever before met you, Gabriel," he said,
advancing and offering his hand. "My name is Maxwell.
I think you've heard of me. I have come for a little talk
on a matter of business."</p>

<p>The blank dismay of Gabriel's face did not escape him,
nor the gesture with which he motioned to Olly to retire.</p>

<p>"It's quite evident," he said to himself, "that the child
knows nothing of this, or is unprepared. I have taken him
by surprise."</p>

<p>"If I mistake not, Gabriel," said Maxwell aloud, "your
little&mdash;er&mdash;girl&mdash;is as much concerned in this matter as yourself.
Why not let her remain?"</p>

<p>"No, no;" said Gabriel, now feeling perfectly convinced
in the depths of his conscience-stricken soul that Maxwell
was here as the legal adviser of the indignant Mrs. Markle.
"No! Olly, run out and get some chips in the wood-house
agin to-morrow morning's fire. Run!"</p>

<p>Olly ran. Maxwell cast a look after the child, wiped his
mouth, and leaning his elbow on the table, fixed his eyes
on Gabriel. "I have called to-night, Gabriel, to see if we
can arrange a certain matter without trouble, and even&mdash;as
I am employed against you&mdash;with as little talk as possible.
To be frank, I am entrusted with the papers in a legal proceeding
against you. Now, see here! is it necessary for
me to say what these proceedings are? Is it even necessary
for me to give the name of my client?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>Gabriel dropped his eyes, but even then the frank honesty
of his nature spoke for him. He raised his head and said
simply&mdash;"No!"</p>

<p>Lawyer Maxwell was for a moment staggered, but only
for a moment. "Good," he said thoughtfully; "you are
frank. Let me ask you now if, to avoid legal proceedings,
publicity, and scandal&mdash;and allow me to add, the almost
absolute certainty of losing in any suit that might be brought
against you&mdash;would you be willing to abandon this house
and claim at once, allowing it to go for damages in the past?
If you would, I think I could accept it for such. I think I
could promise that even this question of a closer relationship
would not come up. Briefly, <i>she</i> might keep her name,
and <i>you</i> might keep yours, and you would remain to each
other as strangers. What do you say?"</p>

<p>Gabriel rose quickly and took the lawyer's hands with
a tremulous grasp. "You're a kind man, Mr. Maxwell,"
he said, shaking the lawyer's hand vigorously; "a good
man. It's a bad business, and you've made the best of it.
Ef you'd been my own lawyer instead o' hers, you couldn't
hev treated me better. I'll leave here at once. I've been
thinking o' doing it ever since this yer thing troubled me;
but I'll go to-morrow. Ye can hev the house, and all it
contains. If I had anything else in a way of a fee to offer
ye, I'd do it. She kin hev the house and all that they is
of it. And then nothing will be said?"</p>

<p>"Not a word," said Maxwell, examining Gabriel curiously.</p>

<p>"No talk&mdash;nothin' in the newspapers?" continued
Gabriel.</p>

<p>"Your conduct toward her and your attitude in this
whole affair will be kept a profound secret, unless you
happen to betray it yourself and that is my one reason
for advising you to leave here."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll do it&mdash;to-morrow," said Gabriel, rubbing his hands.
"Wouldn't you like to have me sign some bit o' paper?"</p>

<p>"No, no," said the lawyer, wiping his mouth with his
hand, and looking at Gabriel as if he belonged to some
entirely new species. "Let me advise you, as a friend, to
sign no paper that might be brought against you hereafter.
Your simple abandonment of the claim and house is
sufficient for our purposes. I will make out no papers in
the case until Thursday; by that time I expect to find no
one to serve them on. You understand?"</p>

<p>Gabriel nodded, and wrung the lawyer's hand warmly.</p>

<p>Maxwell walked toward the door, still keeping his glance
fixed on Gabriel's clear, honest eyes. On the threshold he
paused, and leaning against it, wiped his mouth with a slow
gesture, and said&mdash;"From all I can hear, Gabriel, you are
a simple, honest fellow, and I frankly confess to you, but
for the admission you have made to me, I would have
thought you incapable of attempting to wrong a woman. I
should have supposed it some mistake. I am not a judge of
the motives of men; I am too old a lawyer, and too familiar
with things of this kind to be surprised at men's motives,
or even to judge their rights or wrongs by my own. But
now that we understand each other, would you mind telling
me what was your motive for this peculiar and monstrous
form of deception? Understand me; it will not alter my
opinion of you, which is, that you are not a bad man. But
I am curious to know how you could deliberately set about
to wrong this woman; what was the motive?"</p>

<p>Gabriel's face flushed deeply. Then he lifted his eyes
and pointed to the screen. The lawyer followed the direction
of his finger, and saw Olly standing in the doorway.</p>

<p>Lawyer Maxwell smiled. "It is the sex, anyway," he
said to himself; "perhaps a little younger than I supposed;
of course, his own child." He nodded again, smiled at Olly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
and with the consciousness of a professional triumph, blent
with a certain moral satisfaction that did not always necessarily
accompany his professional success, he passed out
into the night.</p>

<p>Gabriel avoided conversation with Olly until late in the
evening. When she had taken her accustomed seat at his
feet before the fire, she came directly to the point. "What
did he want, Gabe?"</p>

<p>"Nothing partickler," said Gabriel, with an affectation of
supreme indifference. "I was thinking, Olly, that I'd tell
you a story. It's a long time since I told one." It had
been Gabriel's habit to improve these precious moments by
relating the news of the camp, or the current topics of the
day, artfully imparted as pure fiction; but since his pre-occupation
with Mrs. Markle, he had lately omitted it.</p>

<p>Olly nodded her head, and Gabriel went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"Once upon a time they lived a man ez hed lived and
would live&mdash;for thet was wot was so sing'ler about him&mdash;all
alone, 'cept for a little sister ez this man hed, wot he loved
very dearly. They was no one ez this man would ever let
ring in, so to speak, between him and this little sister, and
the heaps o' private confidence, and the private talks about
this and thet, thet this yer man hed with this little sister,
was wonderful to behold."</p>

<p>"Was it a real man&mdash;a pure man?" queried Olly.</p>

<p>"The man was a real man, but the little sister, I oughter
say, was a kind o' fairy, you know, Olly, ez hed a heap o'
power to do good to this yer man, unbeknownst to him
and afore his face. They lived in a sorter paliss in the
woods, this yer man and his sister. And one day this yer
man hed a heap o' troubil come upon him that was sich ez
would make him leave this beautiful paliss, and he didn't
know how to let on to his little sister about it; and so he
up, and he sez to her, sez he, 'Gloriana'&mdash;thet was her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
name&mdash;'Gloriana,' sez he, 'we must quit this beautiful
paliss and wander into furrin parts, and the reason why is
a secret ez I can't tell ye.' And this yer little sister jest
ups and sez, 'Wot's agreeable to you, brother, is agreeable
to me, for we is everything to each other the wide world
over, and variety is the spice o' life, and I'll pack my traps
to-morrow.' And she did. For why, Olly? Why, don't
ye see, this yer little sister was a fairy, and knowed it all
without bein' told. And they went away to furrin parts and
strange places, war they built a more beautiful paliss than
the other was, and they lived thar peaceful like and happy
all the days o' their life."</p>

<p>"And thar wasn't any old witch of a Mrs. Markle to
bother them. When are ye goin', Gabe?" asked the practical
Olly.</p>

<p>"I thought to-morrow," said Gabriel, helplessly abandoning
all allegory, and looking at his sister in respectful awe,
"thet ez, I reckoned, Olly, to get to Casey's in time to take
the arternoon stage up to Marysville."</p>

<p>"Well," said Oily, "then I'm goin' to bed now."</p>

<p>"Olly," said Gabriel reproachfully, as he watched the
little figure disappear behind the canvas, "ye didn't kiss me
fur good-night."</p>

<p>Olly came back. "You ole Gabe&mdash;you!" she said
patronisingly, as she ran her fingers through his tangled
curls, and stooped to bestow a kiss on his forehead from an
apparently immeasurable moral and intellectual height&mdash;"You
old big Gabe, what would you do without me, I'd
like to know?"</p>

<p>The next morning Gabriel was somewhat surprised at
observing Olly, immediately after the morning meal, proceed
gravely to array herself in the few more respectable garments
that belonged to her wardrobe. Over a white muslin frock,
yellow and scant with age, she had tied a scarf of glaring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
cheap pink ribbon, and over this again she had secured, by
the aid of an enormous tortoiseshell brooch, a large black and
white check shawl of her mother's, that even repeated folding
could not reduce in size. She then tied over her yellow
curls a large straw hat trimmed with white and yellow
daisies and pale-green ribbon, and completed her toilet by
unfurling over her shoulder a small yellow parasol. Gabriel,
who had been watching these preparations in great concern,
at last ventured to address the <i>bizarre</i> but pretty little figure
before him.</p>

<p>"War you goin', Olly?"</p>

<p>"Down the gulch to say good-bye to the Reed gals.
'Taint the square thing to vamose the ranch without lettin'
on to folks."</p>

<p>"Ye ain't goin' near Mrs. Markle's, are ye?" queried
Gabriel, in deprecatory alarm.</p>

<p>Oily turned a scornful flash of her clear blue eye upon
her brother, and said curtly, "Ketch me!"</p>

<p>There was something so appalling in her quickness, such
a sudden revelation of quaint determination in the lines of
her mouth and eyebrows, that Gabriel could say no more.
Without a word he watched the yellow sunshade and flapping
straw hat with its streaming ribbons slowly disappear
down the winding descent of the hill. And then a sudden
and grotesque sense of dependence upon the child&mdash;an
appreciation of some reserved quality in her nature hitherto
unsuspected by him&mdash;something that separated them now,
and in the years to come would slowly widen the rift between
them&mdash;came upon him with such a desolating sense of loneliness
that it seemed unendurable. He did not dare to
re-enter or look back upon the cabin, but pushed on vaguely
toward his claim on the hillside. On his way thither he
had to pass a solitary red-wood tree that he had often noticed,
whose enormous bulk belittled the rest of the forest; yet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
also, by reason of its very isolation had acquired a
certain lonely pathos that was far beyond the suggestion of
its heroic size. It seemed so imbecile, so gratuitously large,
so unproductive of the good that might be expected of its
bulk, so unlike the smart spruces and pert young firs and
larches that stood beside it, that Gabriel instantly accepted
it as a symbol of himself, and could not help wondering if
there were not some other locality where everything else
might be on its own plane of existence. "If I war to go
thar," said Gabriel to himself, "I wonder if I might not suit
better than I do yer, and be of some sarvice to thet child."
He pushed his way through the underbrush, and stood upon
the ledge that he had first claimed on his arrival at One
Horse Gulch. It was dreary&mdash;it was unpromising&mdash;a vast
stony field high up in air, covered with scattered boulders
of dark iron-grey rock. Gabriel smiled bitterly. "Any
other man but me couldn't hev bin sich a fool as to preëmpt
sich a claim fur gold. P'r'aps it's all for the best that I'm
short of it now," said Gabriel, as he turned away, and
descended the hill to his later claim in the gulch, which
yielded him that pittance known in the mining dialect as
"grub."</p>

<p>It was nearly three o'clock before he returned to the
cabin with the few tools that he had gathered. When he
did so, he found Olly awaiting him, with a slight flush of
excitement on her cheek, but no visible evidences of any late
employment to be seen in the cabin.</p>

<p>"Ye don't seem to have been doin' much packin', Olly,"
said Gabriel&mdash;"tho' thar ain't, so to speak, much to pack
up."</p>

<p>"Thar ain't no use in packin', Gabe," replied Olly, looking
directly into the giant's bashful eyes.</p>

<p>"No use?" echoed Gabriel.</p>

<p>"No sort o' use," said Olly decidedly. "We ain't goin',<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
Gabe, and that's the end on't. I've been over to see
Lawyer Maxwell, and I've made it all right!"</p>

<p>Gabriel dropped speechless into a chair, and gazed, open-mouthed,
at his sister. "I've made it all right, Gabe,"
continued Olly coolly, "you'll see. I jest went over thar
this morning, and hed a little talk with the lawyer, and giv
him a piece o' my mind about Mrs. Markle&mdash;and jest
settled the whole thing."</p>

<p>"Good Lord! Olly, what did you say?"</p>

<p>"Say?" echoed Olly. "I jest up and told him everythin'
I knew about thet woman, and I never told you, Gabe,
the half of it. I jest sed ez how she'd been runnin' round
arter you ever sence she first set eyes on you, when you was
nussin' her husband wot died. How you never ez much
ez looked at her ontil I set you up to it! How she used
to come round yer, and sit and sit and look at you, Gabe,
and kinder do this et ye over her shoulder."&mdash;(Here Olly
achieved an admirable imitation of certain arch glances of
Mrs. Markle that would have driven that estimable lady
frantic with rage, and even at this moment caused the bashful
blood of Gabriel to fly into his very eyes.) "And how
she used to let on all sorts of excuses to get you over thar,
and how you refoosed! And wot a deceitful, old, mean,
disgustin' critter she was enny way!" and here Olly paused
for want of breath.</p>

<p>"And wot did he say?" said the equally breathless Gabriel.</p>

<p>"Nothin' at first! Then he laughed and laughed, and
laughed till I thought he'd bust! And then&mdash;let me see,"
reflected the conscientious Olly, "he said thar was some
'absurd blunder and mistake'&mdash;that's jest what he called
thet Mrs. Markle, Gabe&mdash;those was his very words! And
then he set up another yell o' laughin', and somehow, Gabe,
I got to laughin', and she got to laughin' too!" And Olly
laughed at the recollection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who's <i>she</i>?" asked Gabriel, with a most lugubrious face.</p>

<p>"O Gabe! you think everybody's Mrs. Markle," said
Olly swiftly. "<i>She</i> was a lady ez was with thet Lawyer
Maxwell, ez heerd it all. Why, Lord! she seemed to take ez
much interest in it as the lawyer. P'r'aps," said Olly, with
a slight degree of conscious pride as <i>raconteur</i>, "p'r'aps it
was the way I told it. I was <i>thet</i> mad, Gabe, and sassy!"</p>

<p>"And what did he say?" continued Gabriel, still ruefully,
for to him, as to most simple, serious natures devoid of any
sense of humour, all this inconsequent hilarity looked suspicious.</p>

<p>"Why, he was fur puttin' right over here 'to explain,' ez
he called it, but the lady stopped him, and sed somethin'
low I didn't get to hear. Oh, she must be a partickler
friend o' his, Gabe&mdash;for he did everythin' thet she said.
And she said I was to go back and say thet we needn't hurry
ourselves to git away at all. And thet's the end of it,
Gabe."</p>

<p>"But didn't he say anythin' more, Olly?" said Gabriel
anxiously.</p>

<p>"No. He begin to ask me some questions about old
times and Starvation Camp, and I'd made up my mind to
disremember all them things ez I told you, Gabe, fur I'm
jest sick of being called a cannon-ball, so I jest disremembered
everything ez fast ez he asked it, until he sez, sez he
to this lady, 'she evidently knows nothin' o' the whole thing.'
But the lady had been tryin' to stop his askin' questions,
and he'd been kinder signin' to me not to answer too. Oh,
she's cute, Gabe; I could see thet ez soon ez I set down."</p>

<p>"What did she look like, Olly?" said Gabriel, with an
affectation of carelessness, but still by no means yet entirely
relieved in his mind.</p>

<p>"Oh, she didn't look like Mrs. Markle, Gabe, or any o'
thet kind. A kinder short woman, with white teeth, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
small waist, and good clo'es. I didn't sort o' take to her
much, Gabe, though she was very kind to me. I don't
know ez I could say ezackly what she did look like; I
reckon thar ain't anybody about yer looks like she. Saints
and goodness! Gabe, that's her now; thar she is!"</p>

<p>Something darkened the doorway. Gabriel, looking up,
beheld the woman he had saved in the cañon. It was
Madame Devarges!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<h2>BOOK III.</h2>

<h3><i>THE LEAD.</i></h3>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

<h5>AN OLD PIONEER OF '49.</h5>


<p>A thick fog, dense, impenetrable, bluish-grey and raw,
marked the advent of the gentle summer of 1854 on the
California coast. The brief immature spring was scarcely
yet over; there were flowers still to be seen on the outlying
hills around San Francisco, and the wild oats were yet green
on the Contra Costa mountains. But the wild oats were
hidden under a dim India-inky veil, and the wild flowers
accepted the joyless embraces of the fog with a staring
waxen rigidity. In short, the weather was so uncomfortable
that the average Californian was more than ever inclined to
impress the stranger aggressively with the fact that fogs were
healthy, and that it was the "finest climate on the earth."</p>

<p>Perhaps no one was better calculated or more accustomed
to impress the stranger with this belief than Mr.
Peter Dumphy, banker and capitalist. His outspoken faith
in the present and future of California was unbounded.
His sincere convictions that no country or climate was ever
before so signally favoured, his intoleration of any criticism
or belief to the contrary, made him a representative man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
So positive and unmistakable was his habitual expression
on these subjects, that it was impossible to remain long in
his presence without becoming impressed with the idea that
any other condition of society, climate, or civilization than
that which obtained in California, was a mistake. Strangers
were brought early to imbibe from this fountain; timid and
weak Californians, in danger of a relapse, had their faith
renewed and their eyesight restored by bathing in this pool
that Mr. Dumphy kept always replenished. Unconsciously,
people at last got to echoing Mr. Dumphy's views as their
own, and much of the large praise that appeared in newspapers,
public speeches, and correspondence, was first voiced
by Dumphy. It must not be supposed that Mr. Dumphy's
positiveness of statement and peremptory manner were at
all injurious to his social reputation. Owing to that suspicion
with which most frontier communities regard polite
concession and suavity of method, Mr. Dumphy's brusque
frankness was always accepted as genuine. "You always
know what Pete Dumphy means," was the average criticism.
"He ain't goin' to lie to please any man." To a conceit
that was so freely and shamelessly expressed as to make
hesitating and cautious wisdom appear weak and unmanly
beside it, Mr. Dumphy added the rare quality of perfect
unconscientiousness unmixed with any adulterating virtue.
It was with such rare combative qualities as these that Mr.
Dumphy sat that morning in his private office and generally
opposed the fog without, or rather its influence upon his
patrons and society at large. The face he offered to it was
a strong one, although superficially smooth, for since the
reader had the honour of his acquaintance, he had shaved
off his beard, as a probably unnecessary indication of character.
It was still early, but he had already despatched
much business with that prompt decision which made even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
an occasional blunder seem heroic. He was signing a letter
that one of his clerks had brought him, when he said briskly,
without looking up&mdash;"Send Mr. Ramirez in."</p>

<p>Mr. Ramirez, who had already called for three successive
days without obtaining an audience of Dumphy, entered the
private room with an excited sense of having been wronged,
which, however, instantly disappeared, as far as external
manifestation was concerned, on his contact with the hard-headed,
aggressive, and prompt Dumphy.</p>

<p>"How do?" said Dumphy, without looking up from his
desk. Mr. Ramirez uttered some objection to the weather,
and then took a seat uneasily near Dumphy. "Go on," said
Dumphy, "I can listen."</p>

<p>"It is I who came to listen," said Mr. Ramirez, with great
suavity. "It is of the news I would hear."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Dumphy, signing his name rapidly to
several documents, "Yes, <i>Yes</i>, <span class="smcap">Yes</span>." He finished them,
turned rapidly upon Ramirez, and said "Yes!" again, in such
a positive manner as to utterly shipwreck that gentleman's
self-control. "Ramirez!" said Dumphy abruptly, "how
much have you got in that thing?"</p>

<p>Mr. Ramirez, still floating on a sea of conjecture, could
only say, "Eh! Ah! It is what?"</p>

<p>"How <i>deep</i> are you? How much would you <i>lose</i>?"</p>

<p>Mr. Ramirez endeavoured to fix his eyes upon Dumphy's.
"How&mdash;much&mdash;would I lose?&mdash;if how? If what?"</p>

<p>"What&mdash;money&mdash;have&mdash;you&mdash;got&mdash;in&mdash;it?" said Mr.
Dumphy, emphasising each word sharply with the blunt end
of his pen on the desk.</p>

<p>"No money! I have much interest in the success of
Madame Devarges!"</p>

<p>"Then you're not 'in' much! That's lucky for you.
Read that letter.&mdash;Show him in!"</p>

<p>The last remark was in reply to a mumbled interrogatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
of the clerk, who had just entered. Perhaps it was lucky
for Mr. Ramirez that Mr. Dumphy's absorption with his
new visitor prevented his observation of his previous visitor's
face. As he read the letter, Ramirez's face first turned to
an ashen-grey hue, then to a livid purple, then he smacked
his dry lips thrice, and said "<i>Carámba!</i>" then with burning
eyes he turned towards Dumphy.</p>

<p>"You have read this?" he asked, shaking the letter
towards Dumphy.</p>

<p>"One moment," interrupted Dumphy, finishing the conversation
with his latest visitor, and following him to the
door. "Yes," he continued, returning to his desk and
facing Ramirez. "Yes!" Mr. Ramirez could only shake
the letter and smile in a ghastly way at Dumphy. "Yes," said
Dumphy, reaching forward and coolly taking the letter out
of Ramirez's hand, "Yes. Seems she is going to get married,"
he continued, consulting the letter. "Going to marry
the brother, the man in possession. That puts you all right;
any way, the cat jumps; and it lets <i>you</i> out." With the air
of having finished the interview, Mr. Dumphy quietly returned
the letter, followed by Ramirez's glaring eyes, to a
pigeon-hole in his desk, and tapped his desk with his penholder.</p>

<p>"And you&mdash;you?" gasped Ramirez hoarsely, "you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>I</i> didn't go into it a dollar. Yet it was a good
investment. She could have made out a strong case. You
had possession of the deed or will, hadn't you? There was
no evidence of the existence of the other woman," continued
Mr. Dumphy, in his usually loud voice, overlooking the
cautionary gestures of Mr. Ramirez with perfect indifference.
"Hello! How do?" he added to another visitor. "I
was sending you a note." Mr. Ramirez rose. His long
finger nails were buried in the yellow flesh of his palms.
His face was quite bloodless, and his lips were dry. "What's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
your hurry?" said Dumphy, looking up. "Come in again;
there's another matter I want you to look into, Ramirez!
We've got some money out on claim that ought to have one
or two essential papers to make it right. I daresay they're
lying round somewhere where you can find 'em. Draw on
me for the expense." Mr. Dumphy did not say this slyly,
nor with any dark significance, but with perfect frankness.
Virtually it said&mdash;"You're a scamp, so am I; whether or
not this other man who overhears us is one likewise, it
matters not." He took his seat again, turned to the latest
comer, and became oblivious of his previous companion.</p>

<p>Luckily for Mr. Ramirez, when he reached the street he
had recovered the control of his features, if not his natural
colour. At least the fog, which seemed to lend a bluish-grey
shade to all complexions, allowed his own livid cheek
to pass unnoticed. He walked quickly, and it appeared
almost unconsciously towards the water, for it was not
until he reached the steamboat wharf that he knew where
he was. He seemed to have taken one step from Mr.
Dumphy's office to the pier. There was nothing between
these two objects in his consciousness. The interval was
utterly annihilated. The steamboat did not leave for
Sacramento until eight that evening, and it was only ten
o'clock now. He had been conscious of this as he walked,
but he could not have resisted this one movement, even if
a futile one, towards the object of his revengeful frenzy.
Ten hours to wait&mdash;ten hours to be passive, inactive&mdash;to
be doing nothing! How could he pass the time? He
could sharpen his knife. He could buy a new one. He
could purchase a better pistol. He remembered passing
a gunsmith's shop with a display of glittering weapons in
its window. He retraced his steps, and entered the shop,
spending some moments in turning over the gunsmith's
various wares. Especially was he fascinated by a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
broad-bladed bowie-knife. "My own make," said the
tradesman, with professional pride, passing a broad, leathery
thumb along the keen edge of the blade. "It'll split a
half-dollar. See!"</p>

<p>He threw a half-dollar on the counter, and with a quick,
straight, down-darting stab pierced it in halves. Mr.
Ramirez was pleased, and professed a desire to make the
experiment himself. But the point slipped, sending the
half-dollar across the shop and cutting a long splintering
furrow in the counter. "Yer narves ain't steady. And ye
try too hard," said the man, coolly. "Thet's the way it's
apt to be with you gents. Ye jest work yourself up into a
fever 'bout a little thing like thet, ez if everything depended
on it. Don't make sich a big thing of it. Take it easy
like this," and with a quick, firm, workmanlike stroke the
tradesman repeated the act successfully. Mr. Ramirez
bought the knife. As the man wrapped it up in paper, he
remarked with philosophic kindness&mdash;"I wouldn't try to
do it agin this mornin'. It's early in the day, and I've
noticed thet gents ez hez been runnin' free all night ain't
apt to do theirselves justice next mornin'. Take it quietly
alone by yourself, this arternoon; don't think you're goin'
to do anythin' big, and you'll fetch it, sure!"</p>

<p>When Mr. Ramirez was in the street again he looked
at his watch. Eleven o'clock! Only one hour gone. He
buttoned his coat tightly over the knife in his breast pocket,
and started on again feverishly. Twelve o'clock found him
rambling over the sand hills near the Mission Dolores. In
one of the by-streets he came upon a woman looking so like
the one that filled all his thoughts, that he turned to look
at her again with a glance so full of malevolence that she
turned from him in terror. This circumstance, his agitation,
and the continual dryness of his lips sent him into a
saloon, where he drank freely, without, however, increasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
or abating his excitement. When he returned to the
crowded streets again he walked quickly, imagining that his
manner was noticed by others, in such intervals as he
snatched from the contemplation of a single intention.
There were several ways of doing it. One was to tax her
with her deceit and then kill her in the tempest of his indignation.
Another and a more favourable thought was to
surprise her and her new accomplice&mdash;for Mr. Ramirez,
after the manner of most jealous reasoners, never gave her
credit for any higher motive than that she had shown to
him&mdash;and kill them both. Another and a later idea was to
spend the strength of his murderous passion upon the man,
and then to enjoy her discomfiture, the failure of her plans,
and perhaps her appeals for forgiveness. But it would still
be two days before he could reach them. Perhaps they
were already married. Perhaps they would be gone! In
all this wild, passionate, and tumultuous contemplation of
an effect, there never had been for a single moment in his
mind the least doubt of the adequacy of the cause. That
he was a <i>dupe</i>,&mdash;a hopeless, helpless dupe,&mdash;was sufficient.
Since he had read the letter, his self-consciousness had
centred upon a single thought, expressed to him in a single
native word, "Bobo." It was continually before his eyes.
He spelled it on the signs in the street. It kept up a dull
monotonous echo in his ears. "Bobo." Ah! she should
see!</p>

<p>It was past noon, and the fog had deepened. Afar from
the bay came the sounds of bells and whistles. If the
steamer should not go? If she should be delayed, as
often happened, for several hours? He would go down
to the wharf and inquire. In the meantime, let the devil
seize the fog! Might the Holy St. Bartholomew damn for
ever the cowardly dog of a captain and the coyote crew
who would refuse to go! He came sharply enough down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Commercial Street, and then, when opposite the Arcade
Saloon, with the instinct that leads desperate men into
desperate places, he entered and glared vindictively around
him. The immense room, bright with lights and glittering
with gilding and mirrors, seemed quiet and grave in contrast
with the busy thoroughfare without. It was still too early
for the usual <i>habitués</i> of the place; only a few of the long
gambling tables were occupied. There was only a single
<i>monte</i> bank "open," and to this Ramirez bent his steps with
the peculiar predilections of his race. It so chanced that
Mr. Jack Hamlin was temporarily in charge of the interests
of this bank, and was dealing in a listless, perfunctory
manner. It may be parenthetically remarked that his own
game was faro. His present position was one of pure
friendliness to the absent dealer, who was taking his dinner
above stairs. Ramirez flung a piece of gold on the table
and lost. Again he attempted fortune and lost. He lost
the third time. Then his pent-up feelings found vent in the
characteristic "<i>Carámba!</i>" Mr. Jack Hamlin looked up.
It was not the oath, it was not the expression of ill-humour,
both of which were common enough in Mr. Hamlin's experience,
but a certain distinguishing quality in the voice
which awoke Jack's peculiarly retentive memory. He
looked up, and, to borrow his own dialect, at once "spotted"
the owner of the voice. He made no outward sign of his
recognition, but quietly pursued the game. In the next
deal Mr. Ramirez won! Mr. Hamlin quietly extended his
<i>croupe</i> and raked down Mr. Ramirez's money with the losers'.</p>

<p>As Mr. Hamlin doubtless had fully expected, Mr.
Ramirez rose with a passionate scream of rage. Whereat
Mr. Hamlin coolly pushed back Mr. Ramirez's stake and
winnings without looking up. Leaving it upon the table,
Ramirez leaped to the gambler's side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>"You would insult me, so! You would ch&mdash;ee&mdash;at!
eh? You would take my money, so!" he said, hoarsely,
gesticulating passionately with one hand, while with the
other he grasped as wildly in his breast.</p>

<p>Mr. Jack Hamlin turned a pair of dark eyes on the
speaker, and said, quietly, "Sit down, Johnny!"</p>

<p>With the pent-up passion of the last few hours boiling in
his blood, with the murderous intent of the morning still
darkling in his mind, with the passionate sense of a new
insult stinging him to madness, Mr. Ramirez should have
struck the gambler to the earth. Possibly that was his intention
as he crossed to his side; possibly that was his
conviction as he heard himself&mdash;<i>he</i>&mdash;Victor Ramirez! whose
presence in two days should strike terror to two hearts in
One Horse Gulch!&mdash;addressed as Johnny! But he looked
into the eyes of Mr. Hamlin and hesitated. What he saw
there I cannot say. They were handsome eyes, clear and
well opened, and had been considered by several members
of a fond and confiding sex as peculiarly arch and tender.
But, it must be confessed, Mr. Ramirez returned to his seat
without doing anything.</p>

<p>"Ye don't know that man," said Mr. Hamlin to the
two players nearest him, in a tone of the deepest confidence,
which was, however, singularly enough, to be heard distinctly
by every one at the table, including Ramirez. "You don't
know him, but I do! He's a desprit character," continued
Mr. Hamlin, glancing at him and quietly shuffling the cards,
"a very desprit character! Make your game, gentlemen!
Keeps a cattle ranch in Sonoma, and a private graveyard
whar he buries his own dead. They call him the 'Yaller
Hawk of Sonoma.' He's outer sorts jest now: probably
jest killed some one up thar, and smells blood." Mr.
Ramirez smiled a ghastly smile, and affected to examine
the game minutely and critically as Mr. Hamlin paused to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
rake in the gold. "He's artful&mdash;is Johnny!" continued
Mr. Hamlin, in the interval of shuffling, "artful and sly!
Partikerly when he's after blood! See him sittin' thar and
smilin'. He doesn't want to interrupt the game. He
knows, gentlemen, thet in five minutes from now, Jim will
be back here and I'll be free. Thet's what he's waitin' for!
Thet's what's the matter with the 'Yaller Slaughterer of
Sonoma!' Got his knife ready in his breast, too. Done
up in brown paper to keep it clean. He's mighty pertikler
'bout his weppins is Johnny. Hez a knife for every new
man." Ramirez rose with an attempt at jocularity, and
pocketed his gains. Mr. Hamlin affected not to notice him
until he was about to leave the table. "He's goin' to wait
for me outside," he exclaimed. "In five minutes, Johnny,"
he called to Ramirez's retreating figure. "If you can't wait,
I'll expect to see you at the Marysville Hotel next week,
Room No. 95, the next room, Johnny, the next room!"</p>

<p>The Mr. Ramirez who reached the busy thoroughfare
again was so different from the Mr. Ramirez who twenty
minutes before had entered the Arcade that his identity
might have easily been doubted. He did not even breathe
in the same way; his cheek, although haggard, had resumed
its colour; his eyes, which hitherto had been fixed and
contemplative, had returned to their usual restless vivacity.
With the exception that at first he walked quickly on leaving
the saloon, and once or twice hurriedly turned to see
if anybody were following him, his manner was totally
changed. And this without effusion of blood, or the indulgence
of an insatiable desire for revenge! As I prefer
to deal with Mr. Ramirez without affecting to know any
more of that gentleman than he did himself, I am unable
to explain any more clearly than he did to himself the
reason for this change in his manner, or the utter subjection
of his murderous passion. When it is remembered that for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
several hours he had had unlimited indulgence, without
opposition, in his own instincts, but that for the last twenty
minutes he had some reason to doubt their omnipotence,
perhaps some explanation may be adduced. I only know
that by half-past six Mr. Ramirez had settled in his mind
that physical punishment of his enemies was not the most
efficacious means of revenge, and that at half-past seven he
had concluded <i>not</i> to take the Sacramento boat. And yet
for the previous six hours I have reason to believe that Mr.
Ramirez was as sincere a murderer as ever suffered the
penalty of his act, or to whom circumstances had not offered
a Mr. Hamlin to act upon a constitutional cowardice.</p>

<p>Mr. Ramirez proceeded leisurely down Montgomery
Street until he came to Pacific Street. At the corner of the
street his way was for a moment stopped by a rattling team
and waggon that dashed off through the fog in the direction
of the wharf. Mr. Ramirez recognised the express and mail
for the Sacramento boat. But Mr. Ramirez did not know
that the express contained a letter which ran as follows&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,&mdash;Yours of the 10th received, and contents noted.
Am willing to make our services contingent upon your success. We
believe your present course will be quite as satisfactory as the plan you
first proposed. Would advise you not to give a personal interview to
Mr. Ramirez, but refer him to Mr. Gabriel Conroy. Mr. Ramirez's
manner is such as to lead us to suppose that he might offer violence,
unless withheld by the presence of a third party.&mdash;Yours respectfully,</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Peter Dumphy</span>."</p></blockquote>

<h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

<h5>A CLOUD OF WITNESSES.</h5>


<p>The street into which Ramirez plunged at first sight appeared
almost impassable, and but for a certain regularity
in the parallels of irregular, oddly-built houses, its original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
intention as a thoroughfare might have been open to grave
doubt. It was dirty, it was muddy, it was ill-lighted; it
was rocky and precipitous in some places, and sandy and
monotonous in others. The grade had been changed two
or three times, and each time apparently for the worse, but
always with a noble disregard for the dwellings, which were
invariably treated as an accident in the original design, or
as obstacles to be overcome at any hazard. The near result
of this large intent was to isolate some houses completely,
to render others utterly inaccessible except by scaling
ladders, and to produce the general impression that they
were begun at the top and built down. The remoter effect
was to place the locality under a social ban, and work a
kind of outlawry among the inhabitants. Several of the
houses were originally occupied by the Spanish native
Californians, who, with the conservative instincts of their
race, still clung to their <i>casas</i> after the Americans had flown
to pastures new and less rocky and inaccessible beyond.
Their vacant places were again filled by other native Californians,
through that social law which draws the members
of an inferior and politically degraded race into gregarious
solitude and isolation, and the locality became known as
the Spanish Quarter. That they lived in houses utterly
inconsistent with their habits and tastes, that they affected
a locality utterly foreign to their inclinations or customs,
was not the least pathetic and grotesque element to a
contemplative observer.</p>

<p>Before, or rather beneath one of these structures, Mr.
Ramirez stopped, and began the ascent of a long flight of
wooden steps, that at last brought him to the foundations
of the dwelling. Another equally long exterior staircase
brought him at last to the verandah or gallery of the second
story, the first being partly hidden by an embankment.
Here Mr. Ramirez discovered another flight of narrower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
steps leading down to a platform before the front door.
It was open. In the hall-way two or three dark-faced men
were lounging, smoking <i>cigaritos</i>, and enjoying, in spite of
the fog, the apparently unsociable <i>négligé</i> of shirt sleeves
and no collars. At the open front windows of the parlour
two or three women were sitting, clad in the lightest and
whitest of flounced muslin skirts, with heavy shawls over
their heads and shoulders, as if summer had stopped at
their waists, like an equator.</p>

<p>The house was feebly lighted, or rather the gloom of
yellowish-browned walls and dark furniture, from which all
lustre and polish had been smoked, made it seem darker.
Nearly every room and all the piazzas were dim with the
yellow haze of burning <i>cigaritos</i>. There were light brown
stains on the shirt sleeves of the men, there were yellowish
streaks on the otherwise spotless skirts of the women; every
masculine and feminine forefinger and thumb was steeped
to its first joint with yellow. The fumes of burnt paper
and tobacco permeated the whole house like some religious
incense, through which occasionally struggled an inspiration
of red peppers and garlic.</p>

<p>Two or three of the loungers addressed Ramirez in terms
of grave recognition. One of the women&mdash;the stoutest&mdash;appeared
at the doorway, holding her shawl tightly over her
shoulders with one hand, as if to conceal a dangerous dishabille
above the waist and playfully shaking a black fan
at the young man with the other hand, applied to him
the various epithets of "Ingrate," "Traitor," and "Judas,"
with great vivacity and volubility. Then she faced him
coquettishly. "And after so long, whence now, thou little
blackguard?"</p>

<p>"It is of business my heart and soul," exclaimed Ramirez,
with hasty and somewhat perfunctory gallantry. "Who is
above?"&mdash;"Those who testify."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>"And Don Pedro?"</p>

<p>"He is there, and the Señor Perkins."</p>

<p>"Good. I will go on after a little," he nodded apologetically,
as he hastily ascended the staircase. On the first
landing above he paused, turned doubtfully toward the
nearest door, and knocked hesitatingly. There was no
response. Ramirez knocked again more sharply and
decidedly. This resulted in a quick rattling of the lock,
the sudden opening of the door, and the abrupt appearance
of a man in ragged alpaca coat and frayed trousers. He
stared fiercely at Ramirez, said in English, "What in h&mdash;&mdash;!
next door!" and as abruptly slammed the door in Ramirez's
face. Ramirez entered hastily the room indicated by the
savage stranger, and was at once greeted by a dense cloud
of smoke and the sound of welcoming voices.</p>

<p>Around a long table covered with quaint-looking legal
papers, maps, and parchments, a half-dozen men were
seated. The greater number were past the middle age,
dark-featured and grizzle-haired, and one, whose wrinkled
face was the colour and texture of red-wood bark, was bowed
with decrepitude.</p>

<p>"He had one hundred and two years day before yesterday.
He is the principal witness to Micheltorrena's signature
in the Castro claim," exclaimed Don Pedro.</p>

<p>"Is he able to remember?" asked Ramirez.</p>

<p>"Who knows?" said Don Pedro, shrugging his shoulder.
"He will swear; it is enough!"</p>

<p>"What animal have we in the next room?" asked Ramirez.
"Is it wolf or bear?"</p>

<p>"The Señor Perkins," said Don Pedro.</p>

<p>"Why is he?"</p>

<p>"He translates."</p>

<p>Here Ramirez related, with some vehemence how he
mistook the room, and the stranger's brusque salutation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
The company listened attentively and even respectfully.
An American audience would have laughed. The present
company did not alter their serious demeanour; a breach
of politeness to a stranger was a matter of grave importance
even to these doubtful characters. Don Pedro explained&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, so it is believed that God has visited him here."
He tapped his forehead. "He is not of their country
fashion at all. He has punctuality, he has secrecy, he has
the habitude. When strikes the clock three he is here;
when it strikes nine he is gone. Six hours to work in
that room! Ah, heavens! The quantity of work&mdash;it is
astounding! Folios! Volumes! Good! it is done.
Punctually at nine of the night he takes up a paper left on
his desk by his <i>padrone</i>, in which is enwrapped ten dollars&mdash;the
golden eagle, and he departs for that day. They tell
to me that five dollars is gone at the gambling table, but no
more! then five dollars for subsistence&mdash;always the same.
Always! Always! He is a scholar&mdash;so profound, so admirable!
He has the Spanish, the French, perfect. He is
worth his weight in gold to the lawyers&mdash;you understand&mdash;but
they cannot use him. To them he says&mdash;'I translate,
lies or what not! Who knows? I care not&mdash;but no more.'
He is wonderful!"</p>

<p>The allusion to the gaming-table revived Victor's recollection,
and his intention in his present visit. "Thou hast
told me, Don Pedro," he said, lowering his voice in confidence,
"how much is fashioned the testimony of the witnesses
in regard of the old land grants by the Governors
and Alcaldes. Good. Is it so?"</p>

<p>Don Pedro glanced around the room. "Of those that are
here to-night five will swear as they are prepared by me&mdash;you
comprehend&mdash;and there is a Governor, a Military
Secretary, an Alcalde, a Comandante, and saints preserve
us! an Archbishop! They are respectable <i>caballeros</i>; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
they have been robbed, you comprehend, by the <i>Americanos</i>.
What matters? They have been taught a lesson. They
will get the best price for their memory. Eh? They will
sell it where it pays best. Believe me, Victor; it is so."</p>

<p>"Good," said Victor. "Listen; if there was a man&mdash;a
brigand, a devil&mdash;an American!&mdash;who had extorted from
Pico a grant&mdash;you comprehend&mdash;a grant, formal, and regular,
and recorded&mdash;accepted of the Land Commission&mdash;and
some one, eh?&mdash;even myself, should say to you it is
all wrong, my friend, my brother&mdash;ah!"</p>

<p>"From Pico?" asked Don Pedro.</p>

<p>"<i>Si</i>, from Pico, in '47," responded Victor,&mdash;"a grant."</p>

<p>Don Pedro rose, opened a secretary in the corner, and
took out some badly-printed, yellowish blanks, with a seal
in the right hand lower corner.</p>

<p>"Custom House paper from Monterey," explained Don
Pedro, "blank with Governor Pico's signature and rubric.
Comprehendest thou, Victor, my friend? A second grant
is simple enough!"</p>

<p>Victor's eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>"But two for the same land, my brother?"</p>

<p>Don Pedro shrugged his shoulders, and rolled a fresh
<i>cigarito</i>.</p>

<p>"There are two for nearly every grant of his late Excellency.
Art thou certain, my brave friend, there are not <i>three</i>
to this of which thou speakest? If there be but one&mdash;Holy
Mother! it is nothing. Surely the land has no value.
Where is this modest property? How many leagues square?
Come, we will retire in this room, and thou mayest talk undisturbed.
There is excellent <i>aguardiente</i> too, my Victor,
come," and Don Pedro rose, conducted Victor into a
smaller apartment, and closed the door.</p>

<p>Nearly an hour elapsed. During that interval the sound
of Victor's voice, raised in passionate recital, might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
been heard by the occupants of the larger room but that
they were completely involved in their own smoky atmosphere,
and were perhaps politely oblivious of the stranger's
business. They chatted, compared notes, and examined
legal documents with the excited and pleased curiosity of
men to whom business and the present importance of its
results was a novelty. At a few minutes before nine Don
Pedro reappeared with Victor. I grieve to say that either
from the reaction of the intense excitement of the morning,
from the active sympathy of his friend, or from the equally
soothing anodyne of <i>aguardiente</i>, he was somewhat incoherent,
interjectional, and effusive. The effect of excessive
stimulation on passionate natures like Victor's is to render
them either maudlin or affectionate. Mr. Ramirez was
both. He demanded with tears in his eyes to be led to
the ladies. He would seek in the company of Manuela,
the stout female before introduced to the reader, that sympathy
which an injured, deceived, and confiding nature like
his own so deeply craved.</p>

<p>On the staircase he ran against a stranger, precise, dignified,
accurately clothed and fitted&mdash;the "Señor Perkins"
just released from his slavery, a very different person from
the one accidentally disclosed to him an hour before, on
his probable way to the gaming table, and his habitual enjoyment
on the evening of the day. In his maudlin condition,
Victor would have fain exchanged views with him in
regard to the general deceitfulness of the fair, and the misfortunes
that attend a sincere passion, but Don Pedro
hurried him below into the parlour, and out of the reach of
the serenely contemptuous observation of the Señor Perkins's
eye. Once in the parlour, and in the presence of the coquettish
Manuela, who was still closely shawled, as if yet uncertain
and doubtful in regard to the propriety of her garments
above the waist, Victor, after a few vague remarks upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
general inability of the sex to understand a nature so profoundly
deep and so wildly passionate as his own, eventually
succumbed in a large black haircloth arm-chair, and
became helplessly and hopelessly comatose.</p>

<p>"We must find a bed here for him to-night," said the
sympathising, but practical Manuela; "he is not fit, poor
imbecile, to be sent to his hotel. Mother of God! what is
this?"</p>

<p>In lifting him out of the chair into which he had subsided
with a fatal tendency to slide to the floor, unless held by
main force, something had fallen from his breast pocket,
and Manuela had picked it up. It was the bowie-knife he
had purchased that morning.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Manuela, "desperate little brigand: he has
been among the <i>Americanos</i>! Look, my uncle!"</p>

<p>Don Pedro took the weapon quietly from the brown
hands of Manuela and examined it coolly.</p>

<p>"It is new, my niece," he responded, with a slight shrug
of his shoulders. "The gloss is still upon its blade. We
will take him to bed."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

<h5>THE CHARMING MRS. SEPULVIDA.</h5>


<p>If there was a spot on earth of which the usual dead monotony
of the California seasons seemed a perfectly consistent
and natural expression, that spot was the ancient and
time-honoured <i>pueblo</i> and Mission of the blessed St. Anthony.
The changeless, cloudless, expressionless skies of summer
seemed to symbolise that aristocratic conservatism which
repelled all innovation, and was its distinguishing mark.
The stranger who rode into the <i>pueblo</i>, in his own conveyance,&mdash;for
the instincts of San Antonio refused to sanction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
the introduction of a stage-coach or diligence that might
bring into the town irresponsible and vagabond travellers,&mdash;read
in the faces of the idle, lounging <i>peons</i> the fact that
the great <i>rancheros</i> who occupied the outlying grants had
refused to sell their lands, long before he entered the one
short walled street and open plaza, and found that he was
in a town where there was no hotel or tavern, and that
he was dependent entirely upon the hospitality of some
courteous resident for a meal or a night's lodging.</p>

<p>As he drew rein in the courtyard of the first large adobe
dwelling, and received the grave welcome of a strange but
kindly face, he saw around him everywhere the past
unchanged. The sun shone as brightly and fiercely on the
long red tiles of the low roofs, that looked as if they had
been thatched with longitudinal slips of cinnamon, even as
it had shone for the last hundred years; the gaunt wolf-like
dogs ran out and barked at him as their fathers and mothers
had barked at the preceding stranger of twenty years before.
There were the few wild half-broken mustangs tethered by
strong riatas before the verandah of the long low <i>Fonda</i>,
with the sunlight glittering on their silver trappings; there
were the broad, blank expanses of whitewashed adobe walls,
as barren and guiltless of record as the uneventful days, as
monotonous and expressionless as the staring sky above;
there were the white, dome-shaped towers of the Mission
rising above the green of olives and pear-trees, twisted,
gnarled, and knotted with the rheumatism of age; there
was the unchanged strip of narrow white beach, and beyond,
the sea&mdash;vast, illimitable, and always the same. The
steamers that crept slowly up the darkening coast line were
something remote, unreal and phantasmal; since the Philippine
galleon had left its bleached and broken ribs in the
sand in 1640, no vessel had, in the memory of man, dropped
anchor in the open roadstead below the curving Point of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Pines, and the white walls, and dismounted bronze cannon
of the Presidio, that looked blankly and hopelessly seaward.</p>

<p>For all this, the <i>pueblo</i> of San Antonio was the cynosure
of the covetous American eye. Its vast leagues of fertile
soil, its countless herds of cattle, the semi-tropical luxuriance
of its vegetation, the salubrity of its climate, and the
existence of miraculous mineral springs, were at once a
temptation and an exasperation to greedy speculators of
San Francisco. Happily for San Antonio, its square leagues
were held by only a few of the wealthiest native gentry.
The ranchos of the "Bear," of the "Holy Fisherman," of
the "Blessed Trinity," comprised all of the outlying lands,
and their titles were patented and secured to their native
owners in the earlier days of the American occupation,
while their comparative remoteness from the populous centres
had protected them from the advances of foreign cupidity.
But one American had ever entered upon the possession
and enjoyment of this Californian Arcadia, and that was
the widow of Don José Sepulvida. Eighteen months ago
the excellent Sepulvida had died at the age of eighty-four,
and left his charming young American wife the sole mistress
of his vast estate. Attractive, of a pleasant, social temperament,
that the Donna Maria should eventually bestow her
hand and the estate upon some loser <i>Americano</i>, who would
bring ruin in the hollow disguise of "improvements" to the
established and conservative life of San Antonio, was an
event to be expected, feared, and, if possible, dropped by
fasting and prayer.</p>

<p>When the Donna Maria returned from a month's visit to
San Francisco after her year's widowhood, alone, and to all
appearances as yet unattached, it is said that a <i>Te Deum</i> was
sung at the Mission church. The possible defection of the
widow became still more important to San Antonio, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
it was remembered that the largest estate in the valley, the
"Rancho of the Holy Trinity," was held by another
member of this deceitful sex&mdash;the alleged natural half-breed
daughter of a deceased Governor&mdash;but happily preserved
from the possible fate of the widow by religious preoccupation
and the habits of a recluse. That the irony of Providence
should leave the fate and future of San Antonio so
largely dependent upon the results of levity, and the caprice
of a susceptible sex, gave a sombre tinge to the gossip of the
little <i>pueblo</i>&mdash;if the grave, decorous discussion of Señores
and Señoras could deserve that name. Nevertheless it was
believed by the more devout that a miraculous interposition
would eventually save San Antonio from the <i>Americanos</i>
and destruction, and it was alleged that the patron saint,
himself accomplished in the art of resisting a peculiar form
of temptation, would not scruple to oppose personally any
undue weakness of vanity or the flesh in helpless widowhood.
Yet, even the most devout and trustful believers, as they
slyly slipped aside veil or <i>manta</i>, to peep furtively at the
Donna Maria entering chapel, in the heathenish abominations
of a Parisian dress and bonnet, and a face rosy with
self-consciousness and innocent satisfaction, felt their hearts
sink within them, and turned their eyes in mute supplication
to the gaunt, austere patron saint pictured on the chancel
wall above them, who, clutching a skull and crucifix as if
for support, seemed to glare upon the pretty stranger with
some trepidation and a possible doubt of his being able to
resist the newer temptation.</p>

<p>As far as was consistent with Spanish courtesy, the
Donna Maria was subject to a certain mild espionage. It
was even hinted by some of the more conservative that a
<i>duenna</i> was absolutely essential to the proper decorum of a
lady representing such large social interests as the widow
Sepulvida, although certain husbands, who had already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
suffered from the imperfect protection of this safeguard,
offered some objection. But the pretty widow, when this
proposition was gravely offered by her ghostly confessor,
only shook her head and laughed. "A husband is the best
<i>duenna</i>, Father Felipe," she said, archly, and the conversation
ended.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was as well that the gossips of San Antonio did
not know how imminent was their danger, or how closely
imperilled were the vast social interests of the <i>pueblo</i> on
the 3rd day of June 1854.</p>

<p>It was a bright, clear morning&mdash;so clear that the distant
peaks of the San Bruno mountains seemed to have encroached
upon the San Antonio valley overnight&mdash;so clear
that the horizon line of the vast Pacific seemed to take in
half the globe beyond. It was a morning, cold, hard, and
material as granite, yet with a certain mica sparkle in its
quality&mdash;a morning full of practical animal life, in which
bodily exercise was absolutely essential to its perfect understanding
and enjoyment. It was scarcely to be wondered
that the Donna Maria Sepulvida, who was returning from
a visit to her steward and major-domo, attended by a single
<i>vaquero</i>, should have thrown the reins forward on the neck
of her yellow mare, "Tita," and dashed at a wild gallop
down the white strip of beach that curved from the garden
wall of the Mission to the Point of Pines, a league beyond.
"Concho," the venerable <i>vaquero</i>, after vainly endeavouring
to keep pace with his mistress's fiery steed, and still
more capricious fancy, shrugged his shoulders, and subsided
into a trot, and was soon lost among the shifting
sand dunes. Completely carried away by the exhilarating
air and intoxication of the exercise, the Donna Maria&mdash;with
her brown hair shaken loose from the confinement of
her little velvet hat, the whole of a pretty foot, and at times,
I fear, part of a symmetrical ankle visible below the flying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
folds of her grey riding-skirt, flecked here and there with
the racing spume of those Homeric seas&mdash;at last reached
the Point of Pines which defined the limits of the peninsula.</p>

<p>But when the gentle Mistress Sepulvida was within a
hundred yards of the Point she expected to round, she saw
with some chagrin that the tide was up, and that each
dash of the breaking seas sent a thin, reaching film of shining
water up to the very roots of the pines. To her still
further discomfiture, she saw also that a smart-looking
cavalier had likewise reined in his horse on the other side
of the Point, and was evidently watching her movements
with great interest, and, as she feared, with some amusement.
To go back would be to be followed by this stranger, and
to meet the cynical but respectful observation of Concho;
to go forward, at the worst, could only be a slight wetting,
and a canter beyond the reach of observation of the
stranger, who could not in decency turn back after her.
All this Donna Maria saw with the swiftness of feminine
intuition, and, without apparently any hesitation in her face
of her intent, dashed into the surf below the Point.</p>

<p>Alas for feminine logic! Mistress Sepulvida's reasoning
was perfect, but her premises were wrong. Tita's first dash
was a brave one, and carried her half round the Point, the
next was a simple flounder; the next struggle sunk her to
her knees, the next to her haunches. She was in a quicksand!</p>

<p>"Let the horse go. Don't struggle! Take the end of
your riata. Throw yourself flat on the next wave, and let
it take you out to sea!"</p>

<p>Donna Maria mechanically loosed the coil of hair rope
which hung over the pommel of her saddle. Then she
looked around in the direction of the voice. But she saw
only a riderless horse, moving slowly along the Point.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>"Quick! Now then!" The voice was seaward now;
where, to her frightened fancy, some one appeared to be
swimming. Donna Maria hesitated no longer; with the
recoil of the next wave, she threw herself forward and was
carried floating a few yards, and dropped again on the
treacherous sand.</p>

<p>"Don't move, but keep your grip on the riata!"</p>

<p>The next wave would have carried her back, but she
began to comprehend, and, assisted by the yielding sand,
held her own and her breath until the under-tow sucked
her a few yards seaward; the sand was firmer now; she
floated a few yards farther, when her arm was seized; she
was conscious of being impelled swiftly through the water,
of being dragged out of the surge, of all her back hair
coming down, that she had left her boots behind her in the
quicksand, that her rescuer was a stranger, and a young
man&mdash;and then she fainted.</p>

<p>When she opened her brown eyes again she was lying on
the dry sand beyond the Point, and the young man was on
the beach below her, holding both the horses&mdash;his own and
Tita!</p>

<p>"I took the opportunity of getting your horse out.
Relieved of your weight, and loosened by the tide, he got
his foot over the riata, and Charley and I pulled him out.
If I am not mistaken, this is Mrs. Sepulvida?"</p>

<p>Donna Maria assented in surprise.</p>

<p>"And I imagine this is your man coming to look for you."
He pointed to Concho, who was slowly making his way
among the sand dunes towards the Point. "Let me assist
you on your horse again. He need not know&mdash;nobody
need know&mdash;the extent of your disaster."</p>

<p>Donna Maria, still bewildered, permitted herself to be
assisted to her saddle again, despite the consequent terrible
revelation of her shoeless feet. Then she became conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
that she had not thanked her deliverer, and proceeded to do
so with such embarrassment that the stranger's laughing
interruption was a positive relief.</p>

<p>"You would thank me better if you were to set off in a
swinging gallop over those sun-baked, oven-like sand-hills,
and so stave off a chill! For the rest, I am Mr. Poinsett,
one of your late husband's legal advisers, here on business
that will most likely bring us together&mdash;I trust much more
pleasantly to you than this. Good morning!"</p>

<p>He had already mounted his horse, and was lifting his
hat. Donna Maria was not a very clever woman, but she
was bright enough to see that his business <i>brusquerie</i> was
either the concealment of a man shy of women, or the
impertinence of one too familiar with them. In either case
it was to be resented.</p>

<p>How did she do it? Ah me! She took the most favourable
hypothesis. She pouted, I regret to say. Then she
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was all your fault!"</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Why, if you hadn't stood there, looking at me and criticising,
I shouldn't have tried to go round."</p>

<p>With this Parthian arrow she dashed off, leaving her
rescuer halting between a bow and a smile.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>

<h5>FATHER FELIPE.</h5>


<p>When Arthur Poinsett, after an hour's rapid riding over the
scorching sand-hills, finally drew up at the door of the
Mission Refectory, he had so far profited by his own advice
to Donna Maria as to be quite dry, and to exhibit very little
external trace of his late adventure. It is more remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
perhaps that there was very little internal evidence either.
No one who did not know the peculiar self-sufficiency of
Poinsett's individuality would be able to understand the
singular mental and moral adjustment of a man keenly alive
to all new and present impressions, and yet able to dismiss
them entirely, without a sense of responsibility or inconsistency.
That Poinsett thought twice of the woman he had
rescued&mdash;that he ever reflected again on the possibilities
or natural logic of his act&mdash;during his ride, no one who
thoroughly knew him would believe. When he first saw
Mrs. Sepulvida at the Point of Pines, he was considering the
possible evils or advantages of a change in the conservative
element of San Antonio; when he left her, he returned to the
subject again, and it fully occupied his thoughts until Father
Felipe stood before him in the door of the refectory. I do
not mean to say that he at all ignored a certain sense of
self-gratulation in the act, but I wish to convey the idea that
all other considerations were subordinate to this sense.
And possibly also the feeling, unexpressed, however, by
any look or manner, that if <i>he</i> was satisfied, everybody else
ought to be.</p>

<p>If Donna Maria had thought his general address a little
too irreverent, she would have been surprised at his greeting
with Father Felipe. His whole manner was changed to one
of courteous and even reverential consideration, of a boyish
faith and trustfulness, of perfect confidence and self-forgetfulness,
and moreover was perfectly sincere. She would
have been more surprised to have noted that the object of
Arthur's earnestness was an old man, and that beyond a
certain gentle and courteous manner and refined bearing,
he was unpicturesque and odd-fashioned in dress, snuffy in
the sleeves, and possessed and inhabited a pair of shoes so
large, shapeless, and inconsistent with the usual requirements
of that article as to be grotesque.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>It was evident that Arthur's manner had previously predisposed
the old man in his favour. He held out two soft
brown hands to the young man, addressed him with a pleasant
smile as "My son," and welcomed him to the Mission.</p>

<p>"And why not this visit before?" asked Father Felipe,
when they were seated upon the little verandah that overlooked
the Mission garden, before their chocolate and
<i>cigaritos</i>.</p>

<p>"I did not know I was coming until the day before
yesterday. It seems that some new grants of the old ex-Governor's
have been discovered, and that a patent is to be
applied for. My partners being busy, I was deputed to come
here and look up the matter. To tell the truth, I was glad
of an excuse to see our fair client, or, at least, be disappointed,
as my partners have been, in obtaining a glimpse of
the mysterious Donna Dolores."</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear Don Arturo," said the Padre, with a slightly
deprecatory movement of his brown hands, "I fear you
will be no more fortunate than others. It is a penitential
week with the poor child, and at such times she refuses to
see any one, even on business. Believe me, my dear boy,
you, like the others&mdash;more than the others&mdash;permit your
imagination to run away with your judgment. Donna Dolores'
concealment of her face is not to heighten or tempt the
masculine curiosity, but alas!&mdash;poor child&mdash;is only to hide
the heathenish tattooings that deface her cheek. You know
she is a half-breed. Believe me, you are all wrong. It is
foolish, perhaps&mdash;vanity&mdash;who knows? but she is a <i>woman</i>&mdash;what
would you?" continued the sagacious Padre,
emphasising the substantive with a slight shrug worthy of
his patron saint.</p>

<p>"But they say, for all that, she is very beautiful," continued
Arthur, with that mischievousness which was his
habitual method of entertaining the earnestness of others,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
and which he could not entirely forego, even with the
Padre.</p>

<p>"So! so! Don Arturo&mdash;it is idle gossip!" said Father
Felipe, impatiently,&mdash;"a brown Indian girl with a cheek as
tawny as the summer fields."</p>

<p>Arthur made a grimace that might have been either of
assent or deprecation.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose this means that I am to look over the
papers with you alone. <i>Bueno!</i> Have them out, and let
us get over this business as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"<i>Poco tiempo</i>," said Father Felipe, with a smile. Then
more gravely, "But what is this? You do not seem to
have that interest in your profession that one might expect
of the rising young advocate&mdash;the junior partner of the
great firm you represent. Your heart is not in your work&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>Arthur laughed.</p>

<p>"Why not? It is as good as any."</p>

<p>"But to right the oppressed? To do justice to the
unjustly accused, eh? To redress wrongs&mdash;ah, my son!
<i>that</i> is noble. That, Don Arturo&mdash;it is <i>that</i> has made you
and your colleagues dear to me&mdash;dear to those who have
been the helpless victims of your courts&mdash;your <i>corregidores</i>."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," interrupted Arthur, hastily, shedding the
Father's praise with an habitual deft ease that was not so
much the result of modesty as a certain conscious pride that
resented any imperfect tribute. "Yes, I suppose it pays as
well, if not better, in the long run. 'Honesty is the best
policy,' as our earliest philosophers say."</p>

<p>"Pardon?" queried the Padre.</p>

<p>Arthur, intensely amused, made a purposely severe and
literal translation of Franklin's famous apothegm, and then
watched Father Felipe raise his eyes and hands to the
ceiling in pious protest and mute consternation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>"And these are your American ethics?" he said at last.</p>

<p>"They are, and in conjunction with manifest destiny,
and the star of Empire, they have brought us here, and&mdash;have
given me the honour of your acquaintance," said
Arthur in English.</p>

<p>Father Felipe looked at his friend in hopeless bewilderment.
Arthur instantly became respectful and Spanish.
To change the subject and relieve the old man's evident
embarrassment, he at once plunged into a humorous description
of his adventure of the morning. The diversion was
only partially successful. Father Felipe became at once
interested, but did not laugh. When the young man had
concluded he approached him, and laying his soft hand on
Arthur's curls, turned his face upward toward him with a
parental gesture that was at once habitual and professional,
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look at me here. I am an old man, Don Arturo.
Pardon me if I think I have some advice to give you that
may be worthy your hearing. Listen, then! You are one
of those men capable of peculiarly affecting and being
affected by women. So! Pardon," he continued, gently,
as a slight flush rose into Arthur's cheek, despite the smile
that came as quickly to his face. "Is it not so? Be not
ashamed, Don Arturo! It is not here," he added, with a
poetical gesture toward the wall of the refectory, where
hung the painted effigy of the blessed St Anthony; "it is
not here that I would undervalue or speak lightly of their
influence. The widow is rich, eh?&mdash;handsome, eh? impulsive?
You have no heart in the profession you have
chosen. What then? You have some in the instincts&mdash;what
shall I say&mdash;the accomplishments and graces you
have not considered worthy of a practical end! You are a
natural lover. Pardon! You have the four S's&mdash;'<i>Sáno</i>,
<i>solo</i>, <i>solicito</i>, <i>y secreto</i>.' Good! Take an old man's advice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
and make good use of them. Turn your weaknesses&mdash;eh?
perhaps it <i>is</i> too strong a word!&mdash;the frivolities and vanities
of your youth into a power for your old age! Eh?"</p>

<p>Arthur smiled a superior smile. He was thinking of the
horror with which the old man had received the axiom he
had recently quoted. He threw himself back in his chair
in an attitude of burlesque sentiment, and said, with
simulated heroics&mdash;</p>

<p>"But what, O my Father! what if a devoted, exhausting
passion for somebody else already filled my heart? You
would not advise me to be false to that? Perish the
thought!"</p>

<p>Father Felipe did not smile. A peculiar expression
passed over his broad, brown, smoothly shaven face, and
the habitual look of childlike simplicity and deferential
courtesy faded from it. He turned his small black eyes
on Arthur, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you think you are capable of such a passion, my
son? Have you had an attachment that was superior to
novelty or self-interest?"</p>

<p>Arthur rose a little stiffly.</p>

<p>"As we are talking of one of my clients and one of your
parishioners, are we not getting a little too serious, Father?
At all events, save me from assuming a bashful attitude
towards the lady with whom I am to have a business interview
to-morrow. And now about the papers, Father,"
continued Arthur, recovering his former ease. "I suppose
the invisible fair one has supplied you with all the necessary
documents and the fullest material for a brief. Go on. I
am all attention."</p>

<p>"You are wrong again, son," said Father Felipe. "It is
a matter in which she has shown even more than her usual
disinclination to talk. I believe but for my interference,
she would have even refused to press the claim. As it is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
I imagine she wishes to make some compromise with the
thief&mdash;pardon me!&mdash;the what do you say? eh? the pre-emptor!
But I have nothing to do with it. All the papers, all
the facts are in the possession of your friend, Mrs. Sepulvida.
You are to see her. Believe me, my friend, if you have
been disappointed in not finding your Indian client, you
will have a charming substitute&mdash;and one of your own race
and colour&mdash;in the Donna Maria. Forget, if you can, what
I have said&mdash;but you will not. Ah, Don Arturo! I know
you better than yourself! Come. Let us walk in the
garden. You have not seen the vines. I have a new
variety of grape since you were here before."</p>

<p>"I find nothing better than the old Mission grape,
Father," said Arthur, as they passed down the branching
avenue of olives.</p>

<p>"Ah! Yet the aborigines knew it not and only valued
it when found wild for the colouring matter contained in
its skin. From this, with some mordant that still remains
a secret with them, they made a dye to stain their bodies
and heighten their copper hue. You are not listening,
Don Arturo, yet it should interest you, for it is the colour
of your mysterious client, the Donna Dolores."</p>

<p>Thus chatting, and pointing out the various objects that
might interest Arthur, from the overflowing boughs of a
venerable fig tree to the crack made in the adobe wall of
the church by the last earthquake, Father Felipe, with characteristic
courteous formality, led his young friend through
the ancient garden of the Mission. By degrees, the former
ease and mutual confidence of the two friends returned,
and by the time that Father Felipe excused himself for a
few moments to attend to certain domestic arrangements
on behalf of his new guest perfect sympathy had been
restored.</p>

<p>Left to himself, Arthur strolled back until opposite the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
open chancel door of the church. Here he paused, and,
in obedience to a sudden impulse, entered. The old church
was unchanged&mdash;like all things in San Antonio&mdash;since the
last hundred years; perhaps there was little about it that
Arthur had not seen at the other Missions. There were the
old rafters painted in barbaric splendour of red and brown
stripes; there were the hideous, waxen, glass-eyed saints,
leaning forward helplessly and rigidly from their niches;
there was the Virgin Mary in a white dress and satin slippers,
carrying the infant Saviour in the opulence of lace long-clothes;
there was the Magdalen in the fashionable costume
of a Spanish lady of the last century. There was the usual
quantity of bad pictures; the portrait, full length, of
the patron saint himself, so hideously and gratuitously
old and ugly that his temptation by any self-respecting
woman appeared more miraculous than his resistance;
the usual martyrdoms in terrible realism; the usual "Last
Judgments" in frightful accuracy of detail.</p>

<p>But there was one picture under the nave which attracted
Arthur's listless eyes. It was a fanciful representation of
Junipero Serra preaching to the heathen. I am afraid that
it was not the figure of that most admirable and heroic
missionary which drew Arthur's gaze; I am quite certain
that it was not the moral sentiment of the subject, but
rather the slim, graceful, girlish, half-nude figure of one of
the Indian converts who knelt at Father Junipero Serra's
feet, in childlike but touching awe and contrition. There
was such a depth of penitential supplication in the young
girl's eyes&mdash;a penitence so pathetically inconsistent with
the absolute virgin innocence and helplessness of the
exquisite little figure, that Arthur felt his heart beat quickly
as he gazed. He turned quickly to the other picture&mdash;look
where he would, the eyes of the little acolyte seemed
to follow and subdue him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>I think I have already intimated that his was not a reverential
nature. With a quick imagination and great poetic
sensibility nevertheless, the evident intent of the picture, or
even the sentiment of the place, did not touch his heart or
brain. But he still half-unconsciously dropped into a seat,
and, leaning both arms over the screen before him, bowed
his head against the oaken panel. A soft hand laid upon his
shoulder suddenly aroused him.</p>

<p>He looked up sharply and met the eyes of the Padre looking
down on him with a tenderness that both touched and
exasperated him.</p>

<p>"Pardon!" said Padre Felipe, gently. "I have broken
in upon your thoughts, child!"</p>

<p>A little more brusquely than was his habit with the
Padre, Arthur explained that he had been studying up a
difficult case.</p>

<p>"So!" said the Padre, softly, in response. "With tears
in your eyes, Don Arturo? Not so!" he added to himself,
as he drew the young man's arm in his own and the two
passed slowly out once more into the sunlight.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER V.</h4>

<h5>IN WHICH THE DONNA MARIA MAKES AN IMPRESSION.</h5>


<p>The Rancho of the Blessed Fisherman looked seaward as
became its title. If the founder of the rancho had shown a
religious taste in the selection of the site of the dwelling, his
charming widow had certainly shown equal practical taste,
and indeed a profitable availing of some advantages that
the founder did not contemplate, in the adornment of the
house. The low-walled square adobe dwelling had been relieved
of much of its hard practical outline by several feminine
additions and suggestions. The tiled roof had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
carried over a very broad verandah, supported by vine-clad
columns, and the lounging corridor had been, in defiance of
all Spanish custom, transferred from the inside of the house
to the outside. The interior courtyard no longer existed.
The sombreness of the heavy Mexican architecture was relieved
by bright French chintzes, delicate lace curtains, and
fresh-coloured hangings. The broad verandah was filled
with the latest novelties of Chinese bamboo chairs and
settees, and a striped Venetian awning shaded the glare of
the seaward front. Nevertheless, Donna Maria, out of respect
to the local opinion, which regarded these changes as
ominous of, if not a symbolical putting off the weeds of
widowhood, still clung to a few of the local traditions. It
is true that a piano occupied one side of her drawing-room,
but a harp stood in the corner. If a freshly-cut novel lay
open on the piano, a breviary was conspicuous on the marble
centre-table. If, on the mantel, an elaborate French clock
with bronze shepherdesses trifled with Time, on the wall
above it an iron crucifix spoke of Eternity.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sepulvida was at home that morning expecting a
guest. She was lying in a Manilla hammock, swung between
two posts of the verandah, with her face partially hidden
by the netting, and the toe of a little shoe just peeping
beyond. Not that Donna Maria expected to receive her
guest thus; on the contrary, she had given orders to her
servants that the moment a stranger <i>caballero</i> appeared on
the road she was to be apprised of the fact. For I grieve
to say that, far from taking Arthur's advice, the details of
the adventure at the Point of Pines had been imparted by
her own lips to most of her female friends, and even to the
domestics of her household. In the earlier stages of a
woman's interest in a man she is apt to be exceedingly communicative;
it is only when she becomes fully aware of the
gravity of the stake involved that she begins to hedge before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
the public. The morning after her adventure Donna
Maria was innocently full of its hero and unreservedly
voluble.</p>

<p>I have forgotten whether I have described her. Certainly
I could not have a better opportunity than the
present. In the hammock she looked a little smaller, as
women are apt to when their length is rigidly defined. She
had the average quantity of brown hair, a little badly
treated by her habit of wearing it flat over her temples&mdash;a
tradition of her boarding-school days, fifteen years ago.
She had soft brown eyes, with a slight redness of the eyelid
not inconsistent nor entirely unbecoming to widowhood; a
small mouth depressed at the corners with a charming,
childlike discontent; white regular teeth, and the eloquence
of a complexion that followed unvaryingly the spirits of her
physical condition. She appeared to be about thirty, and
had that unmistakable "married" look which even the
most amiable and considerate of us, my dear sir, are apt to
impress upon the one woman whom we choose to elect to
years of exclusive intimacy and attention. The late Don
José Sepulvida's private mark&mdash;as well defined as the brand
upon his cattle&mdash;was a certain rigid line, like a grave accent,
from the angle of this little woman's nostril to the corners
of her mouth, and possibly to an increased peevishness of
depression at those corners. It bore witness to the fondness
of the deceased for bear-baiting and bull-fighting, and
a possible weakness for a certain Señora X. of San Francisco,
whose reputation was none of the best, and was not
increased by her distance from San Antonio and the surveillance
of Donna Maria.</p>

<p>When an hour later "Pepe" appeared to his mistress,
bearing a salver with Arthur Poinsett's business card and a
formal request for an interview, I am afraid Donna Maria
was a little disappointed. If he had suddenly scaled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
verandah, evaded her servants, and appeared before her in
an impulsive, forgivable way, it would have seemed consistent
with his character as a hero, and perhaps more in keeping
with the general tenor of her reveries when the servitor
entered. Howbeit, after heaving an impatient little sigh,
and bidding "Pepe" show the gentleman into the drawing-room,
she slipped quietly down from the hammock in a deft
womanish way, and whisked herself into her dressing-room.</p>

<p>"He couldn't have been more formal if Don José had
been alive," she said to herself as she walked to her glass
and dressing-table.</p>

<p>Arthur Poinsett entered the vacant drawing-room not in
the best of his many humours. He had read in the eyes of
the lounging <i>vaqueros</i>, in the covert glances of the women
servants, that the story of his adventure was known to the
household. Habitually petted and spoiled as he had been
by the women of his acquaintance, he was half inclined to
attribute this reference and assignment of his client's
business to the hands of Mrs. Sepulvida, as the result of a
plan of Father Felipe's, or absolute collusion between the
parties. A little sore yet, and irritated by his recollection
of the Padre's counsel, and more impatient of the imputation
of a weakness than anything else, Arthur had resolved
to limit the interview to the practical business on hand, and
in so doing had, for a moment, I fear, forgotten his native
courtesy. It did not tend to lessen his irritation and self-consciousness
when Mrs. Sepulvida entered the room without
the slightest evidence of her recent disappointment visible
in her perfectly easy, frank self-possession, and after a conventional,
half Spanish solicitousness regarding his health
since their last interview, without any further allusions to their
adventure, begged him to be seated. She herself took an
easy chair on the opposite of the table, and assumed at
once an air of respectful but somewhat indifferent attention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe," said Arthur, plunging at once into his subject
to get rid of his embarrassment and the slight instinct
of antagonism he was beginning to feel toward the woman
before him, "I believe&mdash;that is, I am told&mdash;that besides
your own business, you are intrusted with some documents
and facts regarding a claim of the Donna Dolores Salvatierra.
Which shall we have first? I am entirely at your
service for the next two hours, but we shall proceed faster
and with less confusion by taking up one thing at a time."</p>

<p>"Then let us begin with Donna Dolores, by all means,"
said Donna Maria; "my own affairs can wait. Indeed,"
she added, languidly, "I daresay one of your clerks could
attend to it as well as yourself. If your time is valuable&mdash;as
indeed it must be&mdash;I can put the papers in his hands and
make him listen to all my foolish, irrelevant talk. He can
sift it for you, Don Arturo. I really am a child about
business, really."</p>

<p>Arthur smiled, and made a slight gesture of deprecation.
In spite of his previous resolution, Donna Maria's tone of
slight pique pleased him. Yet he gravely opened his note-book,
and took up his pencil without a word. Donna Maria
observed the movements, and said more seriously&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah yes! how foolish! Here I am talking about my
own affairs, when I should be speaking of Donna Dolores!
Well, to begin. Let me first explain why she has put this
matter in my hands. My husband and her father were
friends, and had many business interests in common. As
you have doubtless heard, she has always been very quiet,
very reserved, very religious&mdash;almost a nun. I daresay she
was driven into this isolation by reason of the delicacy of
her position here, for you know&mdash;do you not?&mdash;that her
mother was an Indian. It is only a few years ago that the
old Governor, becoming a widower and childless, bethought
himself of this Indian child, Dolores. He found the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
mother dead, and the girl living somewhere at a distant
Mission as an acolyte. He brought her to San Antonio,
had her christened, and made legally his daughter and
heiress. She was a mere slip of a thing, about fourteen or
fifteen. She might have had a pretty complexion, for some
of these half-breeds are nearly white, but she had been
stained when an infant with some barbarous and indelible
dye, after the savage custom of her race. She is now a
light copper colour, not unlike those bronze shepherdesses
on yonder clock. In spite of all this I call her pretty.
Perhaps it is because I love her and am prejudiced. But
you gentlemen are so critical about complexion and colour&mdash;no
wonder that the poor child refuses to see anybody,
and never goes into society at all. It is a shame! But&mdash;pardon,
Mr. Poinsett, here am I gossiping about your
client's looks, when I should be stating her grievances."</p>

<p>"No, no!" said Arthur, hastily, "go on&mdash;in your own
way."</p>

<p>Mrs Sepulvida lifted her forefinger archly.</p>

<p>"Ah! is it so, Don Arturo? I thought so! Well, it is
a great shame that she is not here for you to judge for
yourself."</p>

<p>Angry with himself for his embarrassment, and for the
rising colour on his cheek, Arthur would have explained
himself, but the lady, with feminine tact, did not permit
him.</p>

<p>"To proceed: Partly because I did not participate in
the prejudices with which the old families here regarded
her race and colour, partly, perhaps, because we were both
strangers here, we became friends. At first she resisted all
my advances&mdash;indeed, I think she was more shy of me than
the others, but I triumphed in time, and we became good
friends. Friends, you understand, Mr. Poinsett, not <i>confidants</i>.
You men, I know, deem this impossible, but Donna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
Dolores is a singular girl, and I have never, except upon
the most general topics, won her from her habitual reserve.
And I possess perhaps her only friendship."</p>

<p>"Except Father Felipe, her confessor?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Sepulvida shrugged her shoulders, and then borrowed
the habitual sceptical formula of San Antonio.</p>

<p>"<i>Quien sabe?</i> But I am rambling again. Now for the
case."</p>

<p>She rose, and taking from the drawer of the secretary an
envelope, drew out some papers it contained, and referred
to them as she went on.</p>

<p>"It appears that a grant of Micheltorena to Salvatierra
was discovered recently at Monterey, a grant of which there
was no record among Salvatierra's papers. The explanation
given is that it was placed some five years ago in trust
with a Don Pedro Ruiz, of San Francisco as security for a
lease now expired. The grant is apparently regular, properly
witnessed, and attested. Don Pedro has written that
some of the witnesses are still alive, and remember it."</p>

<p>"Then why not make the proper application for a
patent?"</p>

<p>"True, but if that were all, Don Arturo would not have
been summoned from San Francisco for consultation.
There is something else. Don Pedro writes that another
grant for the same land has been discovered recorded to
another party."</p>

<p>"That is, I am sorry to say, not a singular experience in
our profession," said Arthur, with a smile. "But Salvatierra's
known reputation and probity would probably be sufficient
to outweigh equal documentary evidence on the other side.
It's unfortunate he's dead, and the grant was discovered
after his death."</p>

<p>"But the holder of the other grant is dead too!" said
the widow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>"That makes it about equal again. But who is he?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Sepulvida referred to her papers, and then said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dr. Devarges."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Devarges," said Mrs. Sepulvida, referring to her notes.
"A singular name&mdash;a foreigner, I suppose. No, really Mr.
Poinsett, you shall not look at the paper until I have copied
it&mdash;it's written horribly&mdash;you can't understand it! I'm
really ashamed of my writing, but I was in such a hurry,
expecting you every moment! Why, la! Mr. Poinsett, how
cold your hands are!"</p>

<p>Arthur Poinsett had risen hurriedly, and reached out
almost brusquely for the paper that she held. But the
widow had coquettishly resisted him with a mischievous
show of force, and had caught and&mdash;dropped his hand!</p>

<p>"And you are pale, too. Dear me! I'm afraid you took
cold that morning," said Mrs. Sepulvida. "I should never
forgive myself if you did. I should cry my eyes out!" and
Donna Maria cast a dangerous look from under her slightly
swollen lids that looked as if they might threaten a deluge.</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing, I have ridden far this morning, and
rose early," said Arthur, chafing his hands with a slightly
embarrassed smile. "But I interrupted you. Pray go on.
Has Dr. Devarges any heirs to contest the grant?"</p>

<p>But the widow did not seem inclined to go on. She was
positive that Arthur wanted some wine. Would he not let
her order some slight repast before they proceeded further
in this horrid business? She was tired. She was quite sure
that Arthur must be so too.</p>

<p>"It is my business," said Arthur, a little stiffly, but, recovering
himself again in a sudden and new alarm of the
widow, he smiled and suggested the sooner the business was
over, the sooner he would be able to partake of her hospitality.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>The widow beamed prospectively.</p>

<p>"There are no heirs that we can find. But there is a&mdash;what
do you call it?&mdash;a something or other&mdash;in possession!"</p>

<p>"A squatter?" said Poinsett, shortly.</p>

<p>"Yes," continued the widow, with a light laugh; "a
'squatter,' by the name of&mdash;of&mdash;my writing is so horrid&mdash;let
me see, oh, yes! 'Gabriel Conroy.'"</p>

<p>Arthur made an involuntary gesture toward the paper with
his hand, but the widow mischievously skipped toward the
window, and, luckily for the spectacle of his bloodless face,
held the paper before her dimpled face and laughing eyes,
as she did so.</p>

<p>"Gabriel Conroy," repeated Mrs. Sepulvida, "and&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;his"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"His sister?" said Arthur, with an effort.</p>

<p>"No, sir!" responded Mrs. Sepulvida, with a slight pout,
"his <i>wife</i>! Sister indeed! As if we married women are
always to be ignored by you legal gentlemen!"</p>

<p>Arthur remained silent, with his face turned toward the sea.
When he did speak his voice was quite natural.</p>

<p>"Might I change my mind regarding your offer of a
moment ago, and take a glass of wine and a biscuit now?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Sepulvida ran to the door.</p>

<p>"Let me look over your notes while you are gone," said
Arthur.</p>

<p>"You won't laugh at my writing?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>Donna Maria tossed him the envelope gaily and flew out of
the room. Arthur hurried to the window with the coveted
memoranda. There were the names she had given him&mdash;but
nothing more! At least this was some slight relief.</p>

<p>The suddenness of the shock, rather than any moral
sentiment or fear, had upset him. Like most imaginative
men, he was a trifle superstitious, and with the first mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
of Devarges's name came a swift recollection of Padre Felipe's
analysis of his own character, his sad, ominous reverie in the
chapel, the trifling circumstance that brought him instead
of his partner to San Antonio, and the remoter chance that
had discovered the forgotten grant and selected him to
prosecute its recovery. This conviction entertained and
forgotten, all the resources of his combative nature returned.
Of course he could not prosecute this claim; of course he
ought to prevent others from doing it. There was every
probability that the grant of Devarges was a true one&mdash;and
Gabriel was in possession! Had he really become
Devarges's heir, and if so, why had he not claimed the grant
boldly? And where was Grace?</p>

<p>In this last question there was a slight tinge of sentimental
recollection, but no remorse or shame. That he might in
some way be of service to her, he fervently hoped. That,
time having blotted out the romantic quality of their early
acquaintance, there would really be something fine and loyal
in so doing, he did not for a moment doubt. He would
suggest a compromise to his fair client, himself seek out and
confer with Grace and Gabriel, and all should be made
right. His nervousness and his agitation was, he was
satisfied, only the result of a conscientiousness and a delicately
honourable nature, perhaps too fine and spiritual for
the exigencies of his profession. Of one thing he was convinced:
he really ought to carefully consider Father Felipe's
advice; he ought to put himself beyond the reach of these
romantic relapses.</p>

<p>In this self-sustained, self-satisfied mood, Mrs. Sepulvida
found him on her return. Since she had been gone, he
said, he had been able to see his way quite clearly into this
case, and he had no doubt his perspicacity was greatly
aided by the admirable manner in which she had indicated
the various points on the paper she had given him. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
was now ready to take up her own matters, only he begged
as clear and concise a brief as she had already made for
her friend. He was so cheerful and gallant that by the
time luncheon was announced the widow found him quite
charming, and was inclined to forgive him for the disappointment
of the morning. And when, after luncheon, he
challenged her to a sharp canter with him along the beach,
by way, as he said, of keeping her memory from taking
cold, and to satisfy herself that the Point of Pines could be
doubled without going out to sea, I fear that, without a
prudent consideration of the gossips of San Antonio before
her eyes, she assented. There could be no harm in riding
with her late husband's legal adviser, who had called, as
everybody knew, on business, and whose time was so
precious that he must return even before the business was
concluded. And then "Pepe" could follow them, to
return with her!</p>

<p>It did not, of course, occur to either Arthur or Donna
Maria that they might outrun "Pepe," who was fat and
indisposed to violent exertion; nor that they should find
other things to talk about than the details of business; nor
that the afternoon should be so marvellously beautiful as to
cause them to frequently stop and admire the stretch of
glittering sea beyond; nor that the roar of the waves was
so deafening as to oblige them to keep so near each other
for the purposes of conversation that the widow's soft breath
was continually upon Arthur's cheek; nor that Donna
Maria's saddle girth should become so loose that she was
forced to dismount while Arthur tightened it, and that he
should be obliged to lift her in his arms to restore her to
her seat again. But finally, when the Point of Pines was
safely rounded, and Arthur was delivering a few parting
words of legal counsel, holding one of her hands in his,
while with the other he was untwisting a long tress of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
blown down hair, that, after buffeting his cheek into colour,
had suddenly twined itself around his neck, an old-fashioned
family carriage, drawn by four black mules with silver
harness, passed them suddenly on the road.</p>

<p>Donna Maria drew her head and her hand away with a
quick blush and laugh, and then gaily kissed her finger-tips
to the retreating carriage. Arthur laughed also&mdash;but a
little foolishly&mdash;and looked as if expecting some explanation.</p>

<p>"You should have your wits about you, sir. Did you
know who that was?"</p>

<p>Arthur sincerely confessed ignorance. He had not
noticed the carriage until it had passed.</p>

<p>"Think what you have lost! That was your fair young
client."</p>

<p>"I did not even see her," laughed Arthur.</p>

<p>"But she saw you! She never took her eyes off you.
Adios!"</p>

<h4>CHAPTER VI.</h4>

<h5>THE LADY OF GRIEF.</h5>


<p>"You will not go to-day," said Father Felipe to Arthur,
as he entered the Mission refectory early the next morning
to breakfast.</p>

<p>"I shall be on the road in an hour, Father," replied
Arthur, gaily.</p>

<p>"But not toward San Francisco," said the Padre.
"Listen! Your wish of yesterday has been attained. You
are to have your desired interview with the fair invisible.
Do you comprehend? Donna Dolores has sent for you."</p>

<p>Arthur looked up in surprise. Perhaps his face did not
express as much pleasure as Father Felipe expected, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
lifted his eyes to the ceiling, took a philosophical pinch of
snuff, and muttered&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Ah, lo que es el mudo!</i>&mdash;Now that he has his wish&mdash;it is
nothing, Mother of God!"</p>

<p>"This is <i>your</i> kindness, Father."</p>

<p>"God forbid!" returned Padre Felipe, hastily. "Believe
me, my son, I know nothing. When the Donna left here
before the <i>Angelus</i> yesterday, she said nothing of this. Perhaps
it is the office of your friend, Mrs. Sepulvida."</p>

<p>"Hardly, I think," said Arthur; "she was so well prepared
with all the facts as to render an interview with Donna
Dolores unnecessary. <i>Bueno</i>, be it so! I will go."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he was ill at ease. He ate little, he was
silent. All the fears he had argued away with such self-satisfied
logic the day before, returned to him again with
greater anxiety. Could there have been any further facts
regarding this inopportune grant that Mrs. Sepulvida had
not disclosed? Was there any particular reason why this
strange recluse, who had hitherto avoided his necessary
professional presence, should now desire a personal interview
which was not apparently necessary? Could it be
possible that communication had already been established
with Gabriel or Grace, and that the history of their previous
life had become known to his client? Had his connexion
with it been in any way revealed to the Donna Dolores?</p>

<p>If he had been able to contemplate this last possibility
with calmness and courage yesterday when Mrs. Sepulvida
first repeated the name of Gabriel Conroy, was he capable
of equal resignation now? Had anything occurred since
then?&mdash;had any new resolution entered his head to which
such a revelation would be fatal? Nonsense! And yet
he could not help commenting, with more or less vague
uneasiness of mind, on his chance meeting of Donna
Dolores at the Point of Pines yesterday and the summons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
of this morning. Would not his foolish attitude with Donna
Maria, aided, perhaps, by some indiscreet expression from
the well-meaning but senile Padre Felipe, be sufficient to
exasperate his fair client had she been cognizant of his first
relations with Grace? It is not mean natures alone that
are the most suspicious. A quick, generous imagination,
feverishly excited, will project theories of character and
intention far more ridiculous and uncomplimentary to
humanity than the lowest surmises of ignorance and imbecility.
Arthur was feverish and edited; with all the instincts
of a contradictory nature, his easy sentimentalism dreaded,
while his combative principles longed for, this interview.
Within an hour of the time appointed by Donna Dolores,
he had thrown himself on his horse, and was galloping
furiously toward the "Rancho of the Holy Trinity."</p>

<p>It was inland and three leagues away under the foot-hills.
But as he entered upon the level plain, unrelieved by any
watercourse; and baked and cracked by the fierce sun into
narrow gaping chasms and yawning fissures, he unconsciously
began to slacken pace. Nothing could be more
dreary, passionless, and resigned than the vast, sunlit, yet
joyless waste. It seemed as if it might be some illimitable,
desolate sea, beaten flat by the north-westerly gales that
spent their impotent fury on its unopposing levels. As far
as the eye could reach, its dead monotony was unbroken;
even the black cattle that in the clear distance seemed to
crawl over its surface, did not animate it; rather by contrast
brought into relief its fixed rigidity of outline. Neither
wind, sky, nor sun wrought any change over its blank,
expressionless face. It was the symbol of Patience&mdash;a hopeless,
weary, helpless patience&mdash;but a patience that was
Eternal.</p>

<p>He had ridden for nearly an hour, when suddenly there
seemed to spring up from the earth, a mile away, a dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
line of wall, terminating in an irregular, broken outline
against the sky. His first impression was that it was the
<i>valda</i> or a break of the stiff skirt of the mountain as it struck
the level plain. But he presently saw the dull red of tiled
roofs over the dark adobe wall, and as he dashed down into
the dry bed of a vanished stream and up again on the
opposite bank, he passed the low walls of a <i>corral</i>, until then
unnoticed, and a few crows, in a rusty, half-Spanish, half-clerical
suit, uttered a croaking welcome to the Rancho of
the Holy Trinity, as they rose from the ground before him.
It was the first sound that for an hour had interrupted the
monotonous jingle of his spurs or the hollow beat of his
horse's hoofs. And then, after the fashion of the country,
he rose slightly in his stirrups, dashed his spurs into the
sides of his mustang, swung the long, horsehair, braided
thong of his bridle-rein, and charged at headlong speed
upon the dozen lounging, apparently listless <i>vaqueros</i>, who,
for the past hour, had nevertheless been watching and waiting
for him at the courtyard gate. As he rode toward them,
they separated, drew up each side of the gate, doffed their
glazed, stiff-brimmed, black <i>sombreros</i>, wheeled, put spurs to
their horses, and in another instant were scattered to the
four winds. When Arthur leaped to the brick pavement of
the courtyard, there was not one in sight.</p>

<p>An Indian servant noiselessly led away his horse.
Another <i>peon</i> as mutely led the way along a corridor over
whose low railings <i>serapes</i> and saddle blankets were hung
in a barbaric confusion of colouring, and entered a bare-walled
ante-room, where another Indian&mdash;old, grey-headed,
with a face like a wrinkled tobacco leaf&mdash;was seated on a
low wooden settle in an attitude of patient expectancy. To
Arthur's active fancy he seemed to have been sitting there
since the establishment of the Mission, and to have grown
grey in waiting for him. As Arthur entered he rose, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
with a few grave Spanish courtesies, ushered him into a
larger and more elaborately furnished apartment, and again
retired with a bow. Familiar as Arthur was with these
various formalities, at present they seemed to have an undue
significance, and he turned somewhat impatiently as a door
opened at the other end of the apartment. At the same
moment a subtle strange perfume&mdash;not unlike some barbaric
spice or odorous Indian herb&mdash;stole through the
door, and an old woman, brown-faced, murky-eyed, and
decrepit, entered with a respectful curtsey.</p>

<p>"It is Don Arturo Poinsett?" Arthur bowed.</p>

<p>"The Donna Dolores has a little indisposition, and claims
your indulgence if she receives you in her own room."</p>

<p>Arthur bowed assent.</p>

<p>"<i>Bueno!</i> This way."</p>

<p>She pointed to the open door. Arthur entered by a
narrow passage cut through the thickness of the adobe
wall into another room beyond, and paused on the threshold.</p>

<p>Even the gradual change from the glaring sunshine of
the courtyard to the heavy shadows of the two rooms he
had passed through was not sufficient to accustom his eyes
to the twilight of the apartment he now entered. For
several seconds he could not distinguish anything but a
few dimly outlined objects. By degrees he saw that there
were a bed, a <i>prie-dieu</i>, and a sofa against the opposite
wall. The scant light of two windows&mdash;mere longitudinal
slits in the deep walls&mdash;at first permitted him only this.
Later he saw that the sofa was occupied by a half-reclining
figure, whose face was partly hidden by a fan, and the white
folds of whose skirt fell in graceful curves to the floor.</p>

<p>"You speak Spanish, Don Arturo?" said an exquisitely
modulated voice from behind the fan, in perfect Castilian.</p>

<p>Arthur turned quickly toward the voice with an indescribable
thrill of pleasure in his nerves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>"A little."</p>

<p>He was usually rather proud of his Spanish, but for once
the conventional polite disclaimer was quite sincere.</p>

<p>"Be seated, Don Arturo."</p>

<p>He advanced to a chair indicated by the old woman
within a few feet of the sofa and sat down. At the same
instant the reclining figure, by a quick, dexterous movement,
folded the large black fan that had partly hidden
her features, and turned her face toward him.</p>

<p>Arthur's heart leaped with a sudden throb, and then, as
it seemed to him, for a few seconds stopped beating. The
eyes that met his were large, lustrous, and singularly
beautiful; the features were small, European, and perfectly
modelled; the outline of the small face was a perfect oval,
but the complexion was of burnished copper! Yet even
the next moment he found himself halting among a dozen
comparisons&mdash;a golden sherry, a faintly dyed meerschaum,
an autumn leaf, the inner bark of the <i>madroño</i>. Of only
one thing was he certain&mdash;she was the most beautiful
woman he had ever seen!</p>

<p>It is possible that the Donna read this in his eyes, for
she opened her fan again quietly, and raised it slowly before
her face. Arthur's eager glance swept down the long curves
of her graceful figure to the little foot in the white satin
slipper below. Yet her quaint dress, except for its colour,
might have been taken for a religious habit, and had a
hood or cape descending over her shoulders not unlike a
nun's.</p>

<p>"You have surprise, Don Arturo," she said, after a pause,
"that I have sent for you, after having before consulted
you by proxy. Good! But I have changed my mind since
then! I have concluded to take no steps for the present
toward perfecting the grant."</p>

<p>In an instant Arthur was himself again&mdash;and completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
on his guard. The Donna's few words had recalled the
past that he had been rapidly forgetting; even the perfectly
delicious cadence of the tones in which it was uttered had
now no power to fascinate him or lull his nervous anxiety.
He felt a presentiment that the worst was coming. He
turned toward her, outwardly calm, but alert, eager, and
watchful.</p>

<p>"Have you any newly discovered evidence that makes
the issue doubtful?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No," said Donna Dolores.</p>

<p>"Is there anything?&mdash;any fact that Mrs. Sepulvida has
forgotten?" continued Arthur. "Here are, I believe, the
points she gave me," he added, and, with the habit of a well-trained
intelligence, he put before Donna Dolores, in a few
well-chosen words, the substance of Mrs. Sepulvida's story.
Nor did his manner in the least betray a fact of which he
was perpetually cognisant&mdash;namely, that his fair client,
between the sticks of her fan, was studying his face
with more than feminine curiosity. When he paused she
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Bueno!</i> That is what I told her."</p>

<p>"Is there anything more?"&mdash;"Perhaps!"</p>

<p>Arthur folded his arms and looked attentive. Donna
Dolores began to go over the sticks of her fan one by one,
as if it were a rosary.</p>

<p>"I have become acquainted with some facts in this case
which may not interest you as a lawyer, Don Arturo, but
which affect me as a woman. When I have told you them,
you will tell me&mdash;who knows?&mdash;that they do not alter the
legal aspect of my&mdash;my father's claim. You will perhaps
laugh at me for my resolution. But I have given you so
much trouble, that it is only fair you should know it is not
merely caprice that governs me&mdash;that you should know why
your visit here is a barren one; why you&mdash;the great advocate&mdash;have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
been obliged to waste your valuable time with
my poor friend, Donna Maria, for nothing."</p>

<p>Arthur was too much pre-occupied to notice the peculiarly
feminine significance with which the Donna dwelt
upon this latter sentence&mdash;a fact that would not otherwise
have escaped his keen observation. He slightly stroked
his brown moustache, and looked out of the window with
masculine patience.</p>

<p>"It is not caprice, Don Arturo. But I am a woman and
on orphan! You know my history! The only friend I
had has left me here alone the custodian of these vast
estates. Listen to me, Don Arturo, and you will understand,
or at least forgive, my foolish interest in the people
who contest this claim. For what has happened to them,
to <i>her</i>, might have happened to me, but for the blessed
Virgin's mediation."</p>

<p>"To <i>her</i>&mdash;who is <i>she</i>?" asked Arthur, quietly.</p>

<p>"Pardon! I had forgotten you do not know. Listen.
You have heard that this grant is occupied by a man and
his wife&mdash;a certain Gabriel Conroy. Good! You have
heard that they have made no claim to a legal title to the
land, except through pre-emption. Good. That is not
true, Don Arturo!"</p>

<p>Arthur turned to her in undisguised surprise.</p>

<p>"This is new matter; this <i>is</i> a legal point of some
importance."</p>

<p>"Who knows?" said Donna Dolores, indifferently. "It
is not in regard of that that I speak. The claim is this.
The Dr. Devarges, who also possesses a grant for the same
land, made a gift of it to the sister of this Gabriel. Do you
comprehend?" She paused, and fixed her eyes on Arthur.</p>

<p>"Perfectly," said Arthur, with his gaze still fixed on the
window; "it accounts for the presence of this Gabriel on
the land. But is she living? Or, if not, is he her legally constituted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
heir? That is the question, and&mdash;pardon me if I
suggest again&mdash;a purely legal and not a sentimental question.
Was this woman who has disappeared&mdash;this sister&mdash;this
sole and only legatee&mdash;a married woman&mdash;had she a
child? Because that is the heir."</p>

<p>The silence that followed this question was so protracted
that Arthur turned towards Donna Dolores. She had
apparently made some sign to her aged waiting-woman, who
was bending over her, between Arthur and the sofa. In a
moment, however, the venerable handmaid withdrew, leaving
them alone.</p>

<p>"You are right, Don Arturo," continued Donna Dolores,
behind her fan. "You see that, after all, your advice is
necessary, and what I began as an explanation of my folly
may be of business importance; who knows? It is good
of you to recall me to that. We women are foolish. You
are sagacious and prudent. It was well that I saw you!"</p>

<p>Arthur nodded assent, and resumed his professional attitude
of patient toleration&mdash;that attitude which the world
over has been at once the exasperation and awful admiration
of the largely injured client.</p>

<p>"And the sister, the real heiress, is gone&mdash;disappeared!
No one knows where! All trace of her is lost. But now
comes to the surface an impostor! a woman who assumes
the character and name of Grace Conroy, the sister!"</p>

<p>"One moment," said Arthur, quietly, "how do you know
that it is an impostor?"</p>

<p>"How&mdash;do&mdash;I&mdash;know&mdash;it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, what are the proofs?"</p>

<p>"I am told so!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Arthur, relapsing into his professional attitude
again.</p>

<p>"Proofs," repeated Donna Dolores, hurriedly. "Is it not
enough that she has married this Gabriel, her brother?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is certainly strong moral proof&mdash;and perhaps legal
corroborative evidence," said Arthur, coolly; "but it will
not legally estop her proving that she is his sister&mdash;if she
can do so. But I ask your pardon&mdash;go on!"</p>

<p>"That is all," said Donna Dolores, sitting up, with a slight
gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>"Very well. Then, as I understand, the case is simply
this: You hold a grant to a piece of laud, actually possessed
by a squatter, who claims it through his wife or sister&mdash;legally
it doesn't matter which&mdash;by virtue of a bequest made
by one Dr. Devarges, who also held a grant to the same
property?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Donna Dolores, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Well, the matter lies between you and Dr. Devarges
only. It is simply a question of the validity of the original
grants. All that you have told me does not alter that
radical fact. Stay! One moment! May I ask how you
have acquired these later details?"</p>

<p>"By letter."</p>

<p>"From whom?"</p>

<p>"There was no signature. The writer offered to prove
all he said. It was anonymous."</p>

<p>Arthur rose with a superior smile.</p>

<p>"May I ask you further, without impertinence, if it is
upon this evidence that you propose to abandon your claim
to a valuable property?"</p>

<p>"I have told you before that it is not a legal question,
Don Arturo," said Donna Dolores, waving her fan a little
more rapidly.</p>

<p>"Good! let us take it in the moral or sentimental aspect&mdash;since
you have purposed to honour me with a request for
my counsel. To begin, you have a sympathy for the orphan,
who does not apparently exist."</p>

<p>"But her brother?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>"Has already struck hands with the impostor, and married
her to secure the claim. And this brother&mdash;what proof is
there that he is not an impostor too?"</p>

<p>"True," said Donna Dolores, musingly.</p>

<p>"He will certainly have to settle that trifling question with
Dr. Devarges's heirs, whoever they may be."</p>

<p>"True," said Donna Dolores.</p>

<p>"In short, I see no reason, even from your own view-point,
why you should not fight this claim. The orphan you
sympathise with is not an active party. You have only a
brother opposed to you, who seems to have been willing to
barter away a sister's birthright. And, as I said before, your
sympathies, however kind and commendable they may be,
will be of no avail unless the courts decide against Dr.
Devarges. My advice is to fight. If the right does not
always succeed, my experience is that the Right, at least, is
apt to play its best card, and put forward its best skill. And
until it does that, it might as well be the Wrong, you know."</p>

<p>"You are wise, Don Arturo. But you lawyers are so
often only advocates. Pardon, I mean no wrong. But if
it were Grace&mdash;the sister, you understand&mdash;what would be
your advice?"</p>

<p>"The same. Fight it out! If I could overthrow your
grant, I should do it. The struggle, understand me, is
there, and not with this wife and sister. But how does it
come that a patent for this has not been applied for before
by Gabriel? Did your anonymous correspondent explain
that fact? It is a point in our favour."</p>

<p>"You forget&mdash;<i>our</i> grant was only recently discovered."</p>

<p>"True! it is about equal, then, <i>ab initio</i>. And the
absence of this actual legatee is in our favour."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because there is a certain human sympathy in juries
with a pretty orphan&mdash;particularly if poor."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>"How do you know she was pretty?" asked Donna
Dolores, quickly.</p>

<p>"I presume so. It is the privilege of orphanage," he
said, with a bow of cold gallantry.</p>

<p>"You are wise, Don Arturo. May you live a thousand
years."</p>

<p>This time it was impossible but Arthur should notice the
irony of Donna Dolores's manner. All his strong combative
instincts rose. The mysterious power of her beauty,
which he could not help acknowledging, her tone of superiority,
whether attributable to a consciousness of this power
over him, or some knowledge of his past&mdash;all aroused his
cold pride. He remembered the reputation that Donna
Dolores bore as a religious devotee and rigid moralist. If
he had been taxed with his abandonment of Grace, with his
half-formed designs upon Mrs. Sepulvida, he would have
coldly admitted them without excuse or argument. In
doing so, he would have been perfectly conscious that he
should lose the esteem of Donna Dolores, of whose value
he had become, within the last few moments, equally conscious.
But it was a part of this young man's singular
nature that he would have experienced a certain self-satisfaction
in the act, that would have outweighed all other
considerations. In the ethics of his own consciousness he
called this "being true to himself." In a certain sense
he was right.</p>

<p>He rose, and, standing respectfully before his fair client,
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have you decided fully? Do I understand that I am
to press this claim with a view of ousting these parties? or
will you leave them for the present in undisturbed possession
of the land?"</p>

<p>"But what do <i>you</i> say?" continued Donna Dolores, with
her eyes fixed upon his face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have said already," returned Arthur, with a patient smile.
"Morally and legally, my advice is to press the claim!"</p>

<p>Donna Dolores turned her eyes away with the slightest
shade of annoyance.</p>

<p>"<i>Bueno!</i> We shall see. There is time enough. Be
seated, Don Arturo. What is this? Surely you will not
refuse our hospitality to-night?"</p>

<p>"I fear," said Arthur, with grave politeness, "that I must
return to the Mission at once. I have already delayed my
departure a day. They expect me in San Francisco to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Let them wait. You shall write that important business
keeps you here, and Diego shall ride my own horse to reach
the <i>embarcadero</i> for the steamer to-night. To-morrow he
will be in San Francisco."</p>

<p>Before he could stay her hand she had rung a small
bronze bell that stood beside her.</p>

<p>"But, Donna Dolores"&mdash;&mdash;Arthur began, hastily.</p>

<p>"I understand," interrupted Donna Dolores. "Diego,"
she continued rapidly, as a servant entered the room,
"saddle Jovita instantly and make ready for a journey.
Then return here. Pardon!" she turned to Arthur. "You
would say your time is valuable. A large sum depends upon
your presence! Good! Write to your partners that I will
pay all&mdash;that no one else can afford to give as large a sum
for your services as myself. Write that here you must stay."</p>

<p>Annoyed and insulted as Arthur felt, he could not help
gazing upon her with an admiring fascination. The imperious
habit of command; an almost despotic control of
a hundred servants; a certain barbaric contempt for the
unlimited revenues at her disposal that prompted the act,
became her wonderfully. In her impatience the quick
blood glanced through her bronzed cheek, her little slipper
tapped the floor imperiously, and her eyes flashed in the darkness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
Suddenly she stopped, looked at Arthur, and hesitated.</p>

<p>"Pardon me; I have done wrong. Forgive me, Don
Arturo. I am a spoiled woman who for five years has
had her own way. I am apt to forget there is any world
beyond my little kingdom here. Go, since it must be so,
go at once."</p>

<p>She sank back on the sofa, half veiled her face with
her fan, and dropped the long fringes of her eyes with a
deprecating and half languid movement.</p>

<p>Arthur stood for a moment irresolute and hesitating, but
only for a moment.</p>

<p>"Let me thank you for enabling me to fulfil a duty
without foregoing a pleasure. If your messenger is trustworthy
and fleet it can be done. I will stay."</p>

<p>She turned towards him suddenly and smiled. A smile
apparently so rare to that proud little mouth and those
dark, melancholy eyes; a smile that disclosed the smallest
and whitest of teeth in such dazzling contrast to the shadow
of her face; a smile that even after its brightness had passed
still left its memory in a dimple in either nut-brown cheek,
and a glistening moisture in the dark eyes&mdash;that Arthur
felt the warm blood rise to his face.</p>

<p>"There are writing materials in the other room. Diego
will find you there," said Donna Dolores, "and I will rejoin
you soon. Thanks."</p>

<p>She held out the smallest and brownest of hands. Arthur
bent over it for a single moment, and then withdrew with
a quickened pulse to the outer room. As the door closed
upon him, Donna Dolores folded her fan, threw herself back
upon the sofa, and called, in a quick whisper&mdash;</p>

<p>"Manuela!"</p>

<p>The old woman reappeared with an anxious face and ran
towards the sofa. But she was loo late; her mistress had
fainted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER VII.</h4>

<h5>A LEAF OUT OF THE PAST.</h5>


<p>Arthur's letter to his partners was a brief explanation of
his delay, and closed with the following sentence&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Search the records for any deed or transfer of the grant from Dr.
Devarges."</p></blockquote>

<p>He had scarcely concluded before Diego entered ready
for the journey. When he had gone, Arthur waited with
some impatience the reappearance of Donna Dolores. To
his disappointment, however, only the solemn major-domo
strode grimly into the room like a dark-complexioned ghost,
and, as it seemed to Arthur, with a strong suggestion of
the Commander in "Don Giovanni" in his manner, silently
beckoned him to follow to the apartment set aside for his
reception. In keeping with the sun-evading instincts of
Spanish Californian architecture the room was long, low,
and half lighted; the two barred windows on either side of
the doorway gave upon the corridor and courtyard below;
the opposite wall held only a small narrow, deeply-embrasured
loop-hole, through which Arthur could see the
vast, glittering, sun-illumined plain beyond. The hard,
monotonous, unwinking glare without did not penetrate the
monastic gloom of this chamber; even the insane, incessant
restlessness of the wind that perpetually beset the bleak
walls was unheard and unfelt in the grave, contemplative
solitude of this religious cell.</p>

<p>Mingled with this grateful asceticism was the quaint contrast
of a peculiar Spanish luxuriousness. In a curtained
recess an immense mahogany bedstead displayed a yellow
satin coverlet profusely embroidered with pink and purple
silk flowers. The borders of the sheets and cases of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
satin pillows were deeply edged with the finest lace. Beside
the bed and before a large armchair heavy rugs of barbaric
colours covered the dark wooden floor, and in front of the
deep oven-like hearth lay an immense bear-skin. About
the hearth hung an ebony and gold crucifix, and, mingled
with a few modern engravings, the usual Catholic saints
and martyrs occupied the walls. It struck Arthur's observation
oddly that the subjects of the secular engravings were
snow landscapes. The Hospice of St. Bernard in winter,
a pass in the Austrian Tyrol, the Steppes of Russia, a Norwegian
plain, all to Arthur's fancy brought the temperature,
of the room down considerably. A small water-colour of
an Alpine flower touched him so closely that it might have
blossomed from his recollection.</p>

<p>Dinner, which was prefaced by a message from Donna
Dolores excusing herself through indisposition, was served in
solemn silence. A cousin of the late Don José Salvatierra
represented the family, and pervaded the meal with a mild
flavour of stale cigaritos and dignified criticism of remote
events. Arthur, disappointed at the absence of the Donna,
found himself regarding this gentleman with some degree
of asperity, and a disposition to resent any reference to his
client's business as an unwarrantable impertinence. But
when the dinner was over, and he had smoked a cigar on
the corridor without further communication with Donna
Dolores, he began to be angry with himself for accepting
her invitation, and savagely critical of the motives that
impelled him to it. He was meditating an early retreat&mdash;even
a visit to Mrs. Sepulvida&mdash;when Manuela entered.</p>

<p>Would Don Arturo grant the Donna his further counsel
and presence?</p>

<p>Don Arturo was conscious that his cheek was flushing,
and that his counsel at the present moment would not have
been eminently remarkable for coolness or judiciousness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
but he followed the Indian woman with a slight inclination
of the head. They entered the room where he had first
met the Donna. She might not have moved from the
position she had occupied that morning on the couch, so
like was her attitude and manner. As he approached her
respectfully, he was conscious of the same fragrance, and
the same mysterious magnetism that seemed to leap from
her dark eyes, and draw his own resisting and unwilling
gaze toward her.</p>

<p>"You will despise me, Don Arturo&mdash;you, whose country-women
are so strong and active&mdash;because I am so little and
weak, and,&mdash;Mother of God!&mdash;so lazy! But I am an invalid,
and am not yet quite recovered. But then I am
accustomed to it. I have lain here for days, Don Arturo,
doing nothing. It is weary-eh? You think? This
watching, this waiting!&mdash;day after day&mdash;always the same!"</p>

<p>There was something so delicately plaintive and tender
in the cadence of her speech&mdash;a cadence that might, perhaps,
have been attributed to the characteristic intonation
of the Castilian feminine speech, but which Arthur could
not help thinking was peculiar to herself, that at the moment
he dared not lift his eyes to her, although he was conscious
she was looking at him. But by an impulse of safety he
addressed himself to the fan.</p>

<p>"You have been an invalid then&mdash;Donna Dolores?"</p>

<p>"A sufferer, Don Arturo."</p>

<p>"Have you ever tried the benefit of change of scene&mdash;of
habits of life? Your ample means, your freedom from the
cares of family or kinship, offer you such opportunities," he
continued, still addressing the fan.</p>

<p>But the fan, as if magnetised by his gaze, became coquettishly
conscious; fluttered, faltered, drooped, and then
languidly folded its wings. Arthur was left helpless.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Donna Dolores: "who knows?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>She paused for an instant, and then made a sign to
Manuela. The Indian woman rose and left the room.</p>

<p>"I have something to tell you, Don Arturo," she
continued, "something I should have told you this
morning. It is not too late now. But it is a secret. It
is only that I have questioned my right to tell it&mdash;not that
I have doubted your honour, Don Arturo, that I withheld
it then."</p>

<p>Arthur raised his eyes to hers. It was her turn to evade
his glance. With her long lashes drooped, she went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is five years ago, and my father&mdash;whom may the
Saints assoil&mdash;was alive. Came to us then at the Presidio
of San Geronimo, a young girl&mdash;an American, a stranger
and helpless. She had escaped from a lost camp in the
snowy mountains where her family and friends were starving.
That was the story she told my father. It was a probable
one&mdash;was it not?"</p>

<p>Arthur bowed his head, but did not reply.</p>

<p>"But the name that she gave was not a true one, as it
appeared. My father had sent an <i>Expedicion</i> to relieve
these people, and they had found among the dead the
person whom this young girl&mdash;the stranger&mdash;assumed to be.
That was their report. The name of the young girl who
was found dead and the name of the young girl who came
to us was the same. It was Grace Conroy."</p>

<p>Arthur's face did not move a muscle, nor did he once
take his eyes from the drooping lids of his companion.</p>

<p>"It was a grave matter&mdash;a very grave matter. And it
was the more surprising because the young girl had at first
given another name&mdash;the name of Grace Ashley&mdash;which
she afterwards explained was the name of the young man
who helped her to escape, and whose sister she at first
assumed to be. My father was a good man, a kind man&mdash;a
saint, Don Arturo. It was not for him to know if she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
were Grace Ashley or Grace Conroy&mdash;it was enough for
him to know that she was alive, weak, helpless, suffering.
Against the advice of his officers, he look her into his own
house, into his own family, into his own fatherly heart, to
wait until her brother, or this Philip Ashley, should return.
He never returned. In six months she was taken ill&mdash;very
ill&mdash;a little child was born&mdash;Don Arturo&mdash;but in the same
moment it died and the mother died&mdash;both, you comprehend&mdash;both
died&mdash;in my arms!"</p>

<p>"That was bad," said Arthur, curtly.</p>

<p>"I do not comprehend," said Donna Dolores.</p>

<p>"Pardon. Do not misunderstand me. I say it was bad,
for I really believe that this girl, the mysterious stranger,
with the <i>alias</i>, was really Grace Conroy."</p>

<p>Donna Dolores raised her eyes and stared at Arthur.</p>

<p>"And why?"</p>

<p>"Because the identification of the bodies by the <i>Expedicion</i>
was hurried and imperfect."</p>

<p>"How know you this?"</p>

<p>Arthur arose and drew his chair a little nearer his fair
client.</p>

<p>"You have been good enough to intrust me with an
important and honourable secret. Let me show my appreciation
of that confidence by intrusting you with one equally
important. I knew that the identification was imperfect
and hurried, because <i>I</i> was present. In the report of the
<i>Expedicion</i> you will find the name, if you have not already
read it, of Lieutenant Arthur Poinsett. That was myself."</p>

<p>Donna Dolores raised herself to a sitting posture.</p>

<p>"But why did you not tell me this before?"</p>

<p>"Because, first, I believed that you knew that I was
Lieutenant Poinsett. Because, secondly, I did <i>not</i> believe
that you knew that Arthur Poinsett and Philip Ashley were
one and the same person."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>"I do not understand," said Donna Dolores slowly, in a
hard metallic voice.</p>

<p>"I am Lieutenant Arthur Poinsett, formerly of the
army, who, under the assumed name of Philip Ashley,
brought Grace Conroy out of Starvation Camp. I am the
person who afterwards abandoned her&mdash;the father of her
child."</p>

<p>He had not the slightest intention of saying this when
he first entered the room, but something in his nature,
which he had never tried to control, brought it out. He
was neither ashamed of it nor apprehensive of its results;
but, having said it, leaned back in his chair, proud, self-reliant,
and self-sustained. If he had been uttering a moral
sentiment he could not have been externally more calm or
inwardly less agitated. More than that, there was a certain
injured dignity in his manner, as he rose, without giving the
speechless and astonished woman before him a chance to
recover herself, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You will be able now to know whether your confidence
has been misplaced. You will be able now to determine
what you wish done, and whether I am the person best
calculated to assist you. I can only say, Donna Dolores,
that I am ready to act either as your witness to the
identification of the real Grace Conroy, or as your legal
adviser, or both. When you have decided which, you shall
give me your further commands, or dismiss me. Until
then, <i>adios!</i>"</p>

<p>He bowed, waved his hand with a certain grand courtesy,
and withdrew. When Donna Dolores raised her stupified
head, the door had closed upon him.</p>

<p>When this conceited young gentleman reached his own
room, he was, I grieve to say, to some extent mentally, and,
if I may use the word, morally exalted by the interview.
More than that, he was in better spirits that he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
since his arrival. From his room he strode out into the
corridor. If his horse had been saddled, he would have
taken a sharp canter over the low hills for exercise, pending
the decision of his fair client, but it was the hour of the
noonday <i>siesta</i>, and the courtyard was deserted. He walked
to the gate, and looked across the plain. A fierce wind
held uninterrupted possession of earth and sky. Something
of its restlessness, just at that instant, was in Arthur's breast,
and, with a glance around the corridor, and a momentary
hesitation, as an opening door, in a distant part of the
building, suggested the possibility of another summons
from Donna Dolores, he stepped beyond the walls.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER VIII.</h4>

<h5>THE BULLS OF THE BLESSED TRINITY.</h5>


<p>The absolute freedom of illimitable space, the exhilaration
of the sparkling sunlight, and the excitement of the opposing
wind, which was strong enough to oblige him to exert
a certain degree of physical strength to overcome it, so
wrought upon Arthur, that in a few moments he had thrown
off the mysterious spell which the Rancho of the Blessed
Trinity appeared to have cast over his spirits, and had
placed a material distance between himself and its gloomy
towers. The landscape, which had hitherto seemed
monotonous and uninspiring, now became suggestive; in
the low dome-shaped hills beyond, that were huddled
together like half-blown earth bubbles raised by the fiery
breath of some long-dead volcano, he fancied he saw the
origin of the mission architecture. In the long sweep of
the level plain, he recognised the calm, uneventful life that
had left its expression in the patient gravity of the people.
In the fierce, restless wind that blew over it&mdash;a wind so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
persistent and perpetual that all umbrage, except a narrow
fringe of dwarfed willows defining the line of an extract
watercourse, was hidden in sheltered cañons and the lee-ward
slopes of the hills&mdash;he recognized something of his
own restless race, and no longer wondered at the barrenness
of the life that was turned towards the invader. "I
daresay," he muttered to himself, "somewhere in the lee-ward
of these people's natures may exist a luxurious growth
that we shall never know. I wonder if the Donna has
not"&mdash;but here he stopped; angry, and, if the truth must
be told, a little frightened at the persistency with which
Donna Dolores obtruded herself into his abstract philosophy
and sentiment.</p>

<p>Possibly something else caused him for the moment to
dismiss her from his mind. During his rapid walk he had
noticed, as an accidental, and by no means an essential
feature of the bleak landscape, the vast herds of crawling,
purposeless cattle. An entirely new and distinct impression
was now forming itself in his consciousness&mdash;namely, that
they no longer were purposeless, vagrant, and wandering,
but were actually obeying a certain definite law of attraction,
and were moving deliberately toward an equally definite
object. And that object was himself!</p>

<p>Look where he would; before, behind, on either side,
north, east, south, west,&mdash;on the bleak hill-tops, on the slope
of the <i>falda</i>, across the dried-up <i>arroyo</i>, there were the same
converging lines of slowly moving objects towards a single
focus&mdash;himself! Although walking briskly, and with a
certain definiteness of purpose, he was apparently the only
unchanging, fixed, and limited point in the now active landscape.
Everything that rose above the dead, barren level
was now moving slowly, irresistibly, instinctively, but unmistakably,
towards one common centre&mdash;himself! Alone
and unsupported, he was the helpless, unconscious nucleus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
of a slowly gathering force, almost immeasurable in its immensity
and power!</p>

<p>At first the idea was amusing and grotesque. Then
it became picturesque. Then it became something for
practical consideration. And then&mdash;but no!&mdash;with the
quick and unerring instincts of a powerful will, he choked
down the next consideration before it had time to fasten
upon or paralyse his strength. He stopped and turned.
The Rancho of the Blessed Trinity was gone! Had it
suddenly sank in the earth, or had he diverged from his
path? Neither; he had simply walked over the little
elevation in the plain beside the <i>arroyo</i> and <i>corral</i>, and had
already left the Rancho two miles behind him.</p>

<p>It was not the only surprise that came upon him suddenly
like a blow between the eyes. The same mysterious
attraction had been operating in his rear, and when he
turned to retrace his steps towards the Mission, he faced
the staring eyes of a hundred bulls not fifty yards away.
As he faced them, the nearest turned, the next rank followed
their example, the next the same, and the next, until in the
distance he could see the movement repeated with military
precision and sequence. With a sense of relief, that he put
aside as quickly as he had the sense of fear, he quickened
his pace, until the nearest bull ahead broke into a gentle
trot, which was communicated line by line to the cattle
beyond, until the whole herd before him undulated like a
vast monotonous sea. He continued on across the <i>arroyo</i>
and past the <i>corral</i> until the blinding and penetrating cloud
of dust, raised by the plunging hoofs of the moving mass
before him, caused him to stop. A dull reverberation of
the plain&mdash;a sound that at first might have been attributed
to a passing earthquake&mdash;now became so distinct that he
turned. Not twenty yards behind him rose the advance
wall of another vast, tumultuous sea of tossing horns and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
undulating backs that had been slowly following his retreat!
He had forgotten that he was surrounded.</p>

<p>The nearest were now so close upon him that he could
observe them separately. They were neither large, powerful,
vindictive nor ferocious. On the contrary, they were
thin, wasted, haggard, anxious beasts, economically equipped
and gotten up, the better to wrestle with a six months'
drought, occasional famine, and the incessant buffeting of the
wind&mdash;wild and untamable, but their staring eyes and nervous
limbs expressed only wonder and curiosity. And when
he ran toward them with a shout, they turned, as had the
others, file by file, and rank by rank, and in a moment were,
like the others, in full retreat. Rather, let me say, retreated
as the others <i>had</i> retreated, for when he faced about again
to retrace his steps toward the Mission, he fronted the bossy
bucklers and inextricable horns of those he had driven only
a few moments ago before him. They had availed themselves
of his diversion with the rear-guard to return.</p>

<p>With the rapidity of a quick intellect and swift perceptions,
Arthur saw at once the resistless logic and utter
hopelessness of his situation. The inevitable culmination
of all this was only a question of time&mdash;and a very brief
period. Would it be sufficient to enable him to reach the
<i>casa</i>? No! Could he regain the <i>corral</i>? Perhaps. Between
it and himself already were a thousand cattle.
Would they continue to retreat as he advanced? Possibly.
But would he be overtaken meanwhile by those in his
rear?</p>

<p>He answered the question himself by drawing from his
waistcoat pocket his only weapon, a small "Derringer,"
and taking aim at the foremost bull. The shot took
effect in the animal's shoulder, and he fell upon his knees.
As Arthur had expected, his nearer comrades stopped
and sniffed at their helpless companion. But, as Arthur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
had not expected, the eager crowd pressing behind over-bore
them and their wounded brother, and in another
instant the unfortunate animal was prostrate and his life
beaten out by the trampling hoofs of the resistless, blind,
and eager crowd that followed. With a terrible intuition
that it was a foreshadowing of his own fate, Arthur turned
in the direction of the <i>corral</i>, and ran for his very life!</p>

<p>As he ran he was conscious that the act precipitated the
inevitable catastrophe&mdash;but he could think of nothing better.
As he ran, he felt, from the shaking of the earth beneath his
feet, that the act had once more put the whole herd in
equally active motion behind him. As he ran, he noticed
that the cattle before him retreated with something of his
own precipitation. But as he ran, he thought of nothing
but the awful fate that was following him, and the thought
spurred him to an almost frantic effort. I have tried to
make the reader understand that Arthur was quite inaccessible
to any of those weaknesses which mankind regard as
physical cowardice. In the defence of what he believed to
be an intellectual truth, in the interests of his pride or his
self-love, or in a moment of passion, he would have faced
death with unbroken fortitude and calmness. But to be
the victim of an accident; to be the lamentable sequel of a
logical succession of chances, without motive or purpose;
to be sacrificed for nothing&mdash;without proving or disproving
anything; to be trampled to death by idiotic beasts,
who had not even the instincts of passion or revenge to
justify them; to die the death of an ignorant tramp, or any
negligent clown&mdash;a death that had a ghastly ludicrousness
in its method, a death that would leave his body a shapeless,
indistinguishable, unrecognisable clod, which affection could
not idealise nor friendship reverence,&mdash;all this brought a
horror with it so keen, so exquisite, so excruciating, that
the fastidious, proud, intellectual being fleeing from it might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
have been the veriest dastard that ever turned his back on
danger. And superadded to it was a superstitious thought
that for its very horror, perhaps, it was a retribution for
something that he dared not contemplate!</p>

<p>And it was then that his strength suddenly flagged. His
senses began to reel. His breath, which had kept pace
with the quick beating of his heart, intermitted, hesitated,
was lost! Above the advancing thunder of hoofs behind
him, he thought he heard a woman's voice. He knew now
he was going crazy; he shouted and fell; he rose again
and staggered forward a few steps and fell again. It was
over now! A sudden sense of some strange, subtle perfume,
beating up through the acrid, smarting dust of the
plain, that choked his mouth and blinded his eyes, came
swooning over him. And then the blessed interposition of
unconsciousness and peace.</p>

<p>He struggled back to life again with the word "Philip"
in his ears, a throbbing brow, and the sensation of an effort
to do something that was required of him. Of all his experience
of the last few moments only the perfume remained.
He was lying alone in the dry bed of the <i>arroyo</i>; on the
bank a horse was standing, and above him bent the dark
face and darker eyes of Donna Dolores.</p>

<p>"Try to recover sufficient strength to mount that horse,"
she said, after a pause.</p>

<p>It was a woman before him. With that innate dread
which all masculine nature has of exhibiting physical weakness
before a weaker sex, Arthur struggled to rise without
the assistance offered by the small hand of his friend.
That, however, even at that crucial moment, he so far
availed himself of it, as to press it, I fear was the fact.</p>

<p>"You came to my assistance alone?" asked Arthur, as
he struggled to his feet.</p>

<p>"Why not? We are equal now, Don Arturo," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
Donna Dolores, with a dazzling smile. "I saw you from
my window. You were rash&mdash;pardon me&mdash;foolish! The
oldest vaquero never ventures a foot upon these plains.
But come; you shall ride with me. There was no time to
saddle another horse, and I thought you would not care
to let others know of your adventure. Am I right?"</p>

<p>There was a slight dimple of mischief in her cheek, and
a quaint sparkle in her dark eye, as she turned her questioning
gaze on Arthur. He caught her hand and raised it
respectfully to his lips.</p>

<p>"You are wise as you are brave, Donna Dolores."</p>

<p>"We shall see. But at present you must believe that I
am right, and do as I say. Mount that horse&mdash;I will help
you if you are too weak&mdash;and&mdash;leave a space for me behind
you!"</p>

<p>Thus adjured, Arthur leaped into the saddle. If his
bones had been broken instead of being bruised, he would
still have found strength for that effort. In another instant
Donna Dolores' little foot rested on his, and she lightly
mounted behind him.</p>

<p>"Home now. Hasten; we will be there before any one
will know it," she said, as she threw one arm around his
waist, with superb unconsciousness.</p>

<p>Arthur lifted the rein and dropped his heels into the
flanks of the horse. In five minutes&mdash;the briefest, as it
seemed to him, he had ever passed&mdash;they were once more
within the walls of the Blessed Trinity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

<h5>MR. AND MRS. CONROY AT HOME.</h5>


<p>The manner in which One Horse Gulch received the news
of Gabriel Conroy's marriage was characteristic of that frank
and outspoken community. Without entering upon the
question of his previous shameless flirtation with Mrs.
Markle&mdash;the baleful extent of which was generally unknown
to the camp&mdash;the nearer objections were based upon the
fact that the bride was a stranger and consequently an object
of suspicion, and that Gabriel's sphere of usefulness in a
public philanthropic capacity would be seriously impaired
and limited. His very brief courtship did not excite any surprise
in a climate where the harvest so promptly followed
the sowing, and the fact, now generally known, that it was
he who saved the woman's life after the breaking of the dam
at Black Cañon, was accepted as a sufficient reason for his
success in that courtship. It may be remarked here that a
certain grim disbelief in feminine coyness obtained at One
Horse Gulch. That the conditions of life there were as
near the perfect and original condition of mankind as could
be found anywhere, and that the hollow shams of society<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
and weak artifices of conventionalism could not exist in
that sincere atmosphere, were two beliefs that One Horse
Gulch never doubted.</p>

<p>Possibly there was also some little envy of Gabriel's success,
an envy not based upon any evidence of his superior
courage, skill, or strength, but only of the peculiar "luck,"
opportunity, or providence, that had enabled him to turn
certain qualities very common to One Horse Gulch to such
favourable account.</p>

<p>"Toe think," said Jo. Briggs, "thet I was allowin'&mdash;only
thet very afternoon&mdash;to go up that cañon arter game, and
didn't go from some derned foolishness or other, and
yer's Gabe, hevin' no call to go thar, jest comes along,
accidental like, and, dern my skin! but he strikes onto a
purty gal and a wife the first lick!"</p>

<p>"Thet's so," responded Barker, "it's all luck. Thar's
thet Cy. Dudley, with plenty o' money and wantin' a wife
bad, and ez is goin' to Sacramento to-morrow to prospect
fur one, and he hez been up and down that cañon time
outer mind, and no dam ever said 'break' to him! No,
sir! Or take my own case; on'y last week when the
Fiddletown coach went over the bank at Dry Creek, wasn't I
the fust man thar ez cut the leaders adrift and bruk open
the coach-door and helped out the passengers? And wot
passengers? Six Chinymen by Jinks&mdash;and a Greaser!
Thet's my luck."</p>

<p>There were few preliminaries to the marriage. The consent
of Olly was easily gained. As an act of aggression
and provocation towards Mrs. Markle, nothing could offer
greater inducements. The superior gentility of the stranger,
the fact of her being a stranger, and the expeditiousness of
the courtship coming so hard upon Mrs. Markle's fickleness
commended itself to the child's sense of justice and feminine
retaliation. For herself, Olly hardly knew if she liked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
her prospective sister; she was gentle, she was kind, she
seemed to love Gabriel&mdash;but Olly was often haunted by a
vague instinct that Mrs. Markle would have been a better
match&mdash;and with true feminine inconsistency she hated her
the more for it. Possibly she tasted also something of the
disappointment of the baffled match-maker in the depths of
her childish consciousness.</p>

<p>It may be fairly presumed that the former Mrs. Devarges
had confided to no one but her lawyer the secret of her
assumption of the character of Grace Conroy. How far or
how much more she had confided to that gentleman was
known only to himself; he kept her secret, whatever might
have been its extent, and received the announcement of
her intended marriage to Gabriel with the superior smile
of one to whom all things are possible from the unprofessional
sex.</p>

<p>"Now that you are about to enter into actual possession,"
said Mr. Maxwell, quietly buttoning up his pocket
again, "I suppose you will not require my services immediately."</p>

<p>It is said, upon what authority I know not, that Madame
Devarges blushed slightly, heaved the least possible sigh as
she shook her head and said, "I hope not," with an evident
sincerity that left her legal adviser in some slight astonishment.</p>

<p>How far her intended husband participated in this
confidence I do not know. He was evidently proud of
alluding to her in the few brief days of his courtship as the
widow of the "great Doctor Devarges," and his knowledge
of her former husband to some extent mitigated in the
public mind the apparent want of premeditation in the
courtship.</p>

<p>"To think of the artfulness of that man," said Sal, confidentially,
to Mrs. Markle, "and he a-gettin' up sympathy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
about his sufferin's at Starvation Camp, and all the while
a-carryin' on with the widder of one o' them onfortunets.
No wonder that man was queer! Wot you allowed in the
innocents o' yer heart was bashfulness was jest conscience.
I never let on to ye, Mrs. Markle, but I allus noticed thet
thet Gabe never could meet my eye."</p>

<p>The flippant mind might have suggested that as both of
Miss Sarah's eyes were afflicted with a cast, there might
have been a physical impediment to this exchange of frankness,
but then the flippant mind never enjoyed the confidence
of this powerful young woman.</p>

<p>It was a month after the wedding, and Mrs. Markle was
sitting alone in her parlour, whither she had retired after
the professional duties of supper were over, when the front
door opened, and Sal entered. It was Sunday evening, and
Sal had been enjoying the brief recreation of gossip with
the neighbours, and, as was alleged by the flippant mind
before alluded to, some coquettish conversation and dalliance
with certain youth of One Horse Gulch.</p>

<p>Mrs. Markle watched her handmaid slowly remove an
immense straw "flat" trimmed with tropical flowers, and
then proceed to fold away an enormous plaid shawl which
represented quite another zone, and then her curiosity got
the better of her prudence.</p>

<p>"Well, and how did ye find the young couple gettin' on,
Sal?"</p>

<p>Sal too well understood the value of coyly-withheld information
to answer at once, and with the instincts of a true
artist, she affected to misunderstand her mistress. When
Mrs. Markle had repeated her question Sal replied, with a
a sarcastic laugh&mdash;</p>

<p>"Axin yer pardin fur manners, but you let on about the
<i>young</i> couple, and <i>she</i> forty if she's anythin'."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Sal," remonstrated Mrs. Markle, with reproachful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
accents, and yet a certain self-satisfaction; "you're
mistaken, sure."</p>

<p>"Well," said Sal, breathlessly slapping her hands on her
lap, "if pearl powder and another woman's har and fancy
doin's beggiles folks, it ain't Sal ez is among the folks fooled.
No, Sue Markle. Ef I ain't lived long enough with a
woman ez owns to thirty-three and hez&mdash;ef it wuz my last
words and God is my jedge&mdash;the neck and arms of a gal of
sixteen, not to know when a woman is trying to warm over
the scraps of forty year with a kind o' hash o' twenty, then
Sal Clark ain't got no eyes, thet's all."</p>

<p>Mrs. Markle blushed slightly under the direct flattery of
Sal, and continued&mdash;</p>

<p>"Some folks says she's purty."</p>

<p>"Some men's meat is other men's pizen," responded Sal,
sententiously, unfastening an enormous black velvet zone,
and apparently permitting her figure to fall into instant
ruin.</p>

<p>"How did they look?" said Mrs. Markle, after a pause,
recommencing her darning, which she had put down.</p>

<p>"Well, purty much as I allowed they would from the
first. Thar ain't any love wasted over thar. My opinion
is thet he's sick of his bargin. She runs the house and
ev'ry thing that's in it. Jest look at the critter! She's just
put that thar Gabe up to prospecting all along the ledge
here, and that fool's left his diggin's and hez been running
hither and yon, making ridiklus holes all over the hill jest
to satisfy thet woman, and she ain't satisfied neither. Take
my word for it, Sue Markle, thar's suthin' wrong thar. And
then thar's thet Olly"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mrs. Markle raised her eyes quickly, and put down her
work. "Olly," she repeated, with great animation&mdash;"poor
little Olly! what's gone of her?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Sal, with an impatient toss of her head, "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
never did see what thar wuz in that peart and sassy piece
for any one to take to&mdash;leastwise a woman with a child of
her own. The airs and graces thet thet Olly would put on
wuz too much. Why, she hedn't been nigh us for a month,
and the day afore the wedding what does that limb do but
meet me and sez, sez she, 'Sal, ye kin tell Mrs. Markle as
my brother Gabe ez goin' to marry a lady&mdash;a lady,' sez she.
'Thar ain't goin' to be enny Pikes about our cabin.' And
thet child only eight years! Oh, git out thar! I ain't no
patience!"</p>

<p>To the infinite credit of a much abused sex, be it recorded
that Mrs. Markle overlooked the implied slur, and asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"But what about Olly?"</p>

<p>"I mean to say," said Sal, "thet thet child hain't no place
in thet house, and thet Gabe is jest thet weak and mean
spirited ez to let thet woman have her own way. No
wonder thet the child was crying when I met her out in the
woods yonder."</p>

<p>Mrs. Markle instantly flushed, and her black eyes snapped
ominously. "I should jest like to ketch&mdash;" she began quickly,
and then stopped and looked at her companion. "Sal,"
she said, with swift vehemence, "I must see thet child."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>The word in Sal's dialect had a various, large, and
catholic significance. Mrs. Markle understood it, and repeated
briefly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Olly&mdash;I must see her&mdash;right off!"</p>

<p>"Which?" continued Sal.</p>

<p>"Here," replied Mrs. Markle; "anywhere. Fetch her
when ye kin."</p>

<p>"She won't come."</p>

<p>"Then I'll go to her," said Mrs. Markle, with a sudden
and characteristic determination that closed the conversation
and sent Sal back viciously to her unwashed dishes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever might have been the truth of Sal's report, there
was certainly no general external indication of the facts.
The newly-married couple were, to all appearances, as happy
and contented, and as enviable to the masculine inhabitants
of One Horse Gulch, as any who had ever built a nest within
its pastoral close. If a majority of Gabriel's visitor were
gentlemen, it was easily attributed to the preponderance of
males in the settlement. If these gentlemen were unanimously
extravagant in their praise of Mrs. Conroy, it was as
easily attributable to the same cause. That Gabriel should
dig purposeless holes over the hill-side, that he should for
the time abandon his regular occupation in his little modest
claim in the cañon, was quite consistent with the ambition
of a newly-married man.</p>

<p>A few evenings after this, Gabriel Conroy was sitting
alone by the hearth of that new house, which popular
opinion and the tastes of Mrs. Conroy seemed to think was
essential to his new condition. It was a larger, more ambitious,
more expensive, and perhaps less comfortable dwelling
than the one in which he has been introduced to the
reader. It was projected upon that credit which a man of
family was sure to obtain in One Horse Gulch, where the
immigration and establishment of families and household
centres were fostered even at pecuniary risks. It contained,
beside the chambers, the gratuitous addition of a parlour,
which at this moment was adorned and made attractive by
the presence of Mrs. Conroy, who was entertaining a few
visitors that, under her attractions, had prolonged their
sitting until late. When the laugh had ceased and the
door closed on the last lingering imbecile, Mrs. Conroy
returned to the sitting-room. It was dark, for Gabriel had
not lighted a candle yet, and he was occupying his favourite
seat and attitude before the fire.</p>

<p>"Why! are <i>you</i> there?" said Mrs. Conroy, gaily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>Gabriel looked up, and with that seriousness which was
habitual to him, replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Mrs. Conroy approached her lord and master, and ran
her thin, claw-like fingers through his hair with married
audacity. He caught them, held them for a moment with
a kindly, caressing, and yet slightly embarrassed air that
the lady did not like. She withdrew them quickly.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you come into the parlour?" she said,
examining him curiously.</p>

<p>"I didn't admire to to-night," returned Gabriel, with
grave simplicity, "and I reckoned you'd get on as well
without me."</p>

<p>There was not the slightest trace of bitterness nor
aggrieved sensitiveness in his tone or manner, and although
Mrs. Conroy eyed him sharply for any latent spark of
jealousy, she was forced to admit to herself that it did not
exist in the quiet, serious man before her. Vaguely aware
of some annoyance in his wife's face, Gabriel reached out
his arm, and, lightly taking her around her waist, drew her
to his knee. But the very act was so evidently a recognition
of a certain kind of physical and moral weakness
in the creature before him&mdash;so professional&mdash;so, as Mrs.
Conroy put it to herself,&mdash;"like as if I were a sick man,"
that her irritation was not soothed. She rose quickly and
seated herself on the other side of the fireplace. With the
same implied toleration Gabriel had already displayed, he
now made no attempt to restrain her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Conroy did not pout as another woman might have
done. She only smiled a haggard smile that deepened the
line of her nostril into her cheek, and pinched her thin,
straight nose. Then she said, looking at the fire&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ain't you well?"</p>

<p>"I reckon not&mdash;not overly well."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a silence, both looking at the fire.</p>

<p>"You don't get anything out of that hill-side?" asked
Mrs. Conroy at last, pettishly.</p>

<p>"No," said Gabriel.</p>

<p>"You have prospected all over the ridge?" continued
the woman, impatiently.</p>

<p>"All over!"</p>

<p>"And you don't find anything?"</p>

<p>"Nothin'," said Gabriel. "Nary. Thet is," he added
with his usual cautious deliberation, "thet is, nothin' o' any
account. The gold, ef there is any, lies lower down in the
gulch, whar I used to dig. But I kept at it jest to satisfy
your whim. You know, July, it <i>was</i> a whim of yours," he
continued, with a certain gentle deprecatoriness of manner.</p>

<p>A terrible thought flashed suddenly upon Mrs. Conroy.
Could Dr. Devarges have made a mistake? Might he not
have been delirious or insane when he wrote of the treasure?
Or had the Secretary deceived her as to its location? A
swift and sickening sense that all she had gained, or was to
gain, from her scheme, was the man before her&mdash;and that
<i>he</i> did not love her as other men had&mdash;asserted itself through
her trembling consciousness. Mrs. Conroy had already
begun to fear that she loved this husband, and it was with
a new sense of yearning and dependence that she in her
turn looked deprecatingly and submissively into his face
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"It <i>was</i> only a whim, dear&mdash;I dare say a foolish one.
It's gone now. Don't mind it!"</p>

<p>"I don't," said Gabriel, simply.</p>

<p>Mrs. Conroy winced.</p>

<p>"I thought you looked disappointed," she said after a
pause.</p>

<p>"It ain't that I was thinkin' on, July; it's Olly," said
Gabriel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a limit even to a frightened woman's submission.</p>

<p>"Of course," she said, sharply; "Olly, Olly again and
always. I ought to have remembered that."</p>

<p>"Thet's so," said Gabriel with the same exasperating
quiet. "I was reckonin' jest now, ez there don't seem to
be any likeliness of you and Olly's gettin' on together, you'd
better separate. Thar ain't no sense goin' on this way,
July&mdash;no sense et all. And the worst o' the hull thing ez
thet Olly ain't gettin' no kinder good outer it, no way!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Conroy was very pale and dangerously quiet as Mr.
Conroy went on.</p>

<p>"I've allers allowed to send that child to school, but she
don't keer to go. She's thet foolish, thet Olly is, thet she
doesn't like to leave me, and I reckon I'm thet foolish too
thet I don't like to hev her go. The only way to put things
square ez this"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mrs. Conroy turned and fixed her grey eyes upon her
husband, but she did not speak.</p>

<p>"You'd better go away," continued Gabriel, quietly, "for
a while. I've heerd afore now that it's the reg'lar thing
fur a bride to go away and visit her mother. You hain't
got no mother," said Gabriel thoughtfully, "hev ye?&mdash;that's
bad. But you was a sayin' the other day suthin' about some
business you had down at 'Frisco. Now it would be about
the nateral sort o' thing for ye to go thar fur two or three
months, jest till things get round square with Olly and
me."</p>

<p>It is probable that Gabriel was the only man from whom
Mrs. Conroy could have received this humiliating proposition
without interrupting him with a burst of indignation.
Yet she only turned a rigid face towards the fire again with
a hysterical laugh.</p>

<p>"Why limit my stay to two or three months?" she said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, it might be four," said Gabriel, simply&mdash;"it would
give me and Olly a longer time to get things in shape."</p>

<p>Mrs. Conroy rose and walked rigidly to her husband's side.</p>

<p>"What," she said huskily, "what if I were to refuse?"</p>

<p>Gabriel looked as if this suggestion would not have been
startling or inconsistent as an abstract possibility in woman,
but said nothing.</p>

<p>"What," continued Mrs. Conroy, more rapidly and
huskily, "what if I were to tell <i>you</i> and that brat to go!
What," she said, suddenly raising her voice to a thin high
soprano, "what if I were to turn you both out of this
house&mdash;<i>my</i> house! off this land&mdash;<i>my</i> land! Eh? eh? eh?"
she almost screamed, emphasising each interrogatory with
her thin hand on Gabriel's shoulder, in a desperate but impotent
attempt to shake him.</p>

<p>"Certingly, certingly," said Gabriel calmly. "But thar's
somebody at the door, July," he continued quietly, as he
rose slowly and walked into the hall.</p>

<p>His quick ear had detected a knocking without, above
the truculent pitch of Mrs. Conroy's voice. He threw open
the door, and disclosed Olly and Sal standing upon the
threshold.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to say that Sal was first to recover
the use of that noble organ, the tongue.</p>

<p>"With chills and ager in every breath&mdash;it's an hour if it's
five minutes that we've stood here," she began, "pounding
at that door. 'You're interrupting the young couple, Sal,'
sez I, 'comin' yer this time o' night, breakin' in, so to speak,
on the holiest confidences,' sez I; 'but it's business, and
onless you hev thet to back you, Sarah Clark,' I sez, 'and
you ain't a woman ez ever turned her back on thet or them,
you ain't no call there.' But I was to fetch this child home,
Mrs. Conroy," continued Sal, pushing her way into the little
sitting-room, "and"&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>She paused, for the room was vacant. Mrs. Conroy had
disappeared.</p>

<p>"I thought I heerd"&mdash;&mdash;said Sal, completely taken
aback.</p>

<p>"It was only Gabe," said Olly, with the ready mendacity
of swift feminine tact. "I told you so. Thank you, Sal,
for seeing me home. Good night, Sal," and, with a dexterity
that smote Gabriel into awesome and admiring silence,
she absolutely led the breathless Sal to the door and closed
it upon her before that astonished female could recover her
speech.</p>

<p>Then she returned quietly, took off her hat and shawl, and
taking the unresisting hand of her brother, led him back to
his former seat by the fire. Drawing a low stool in front
of him, she proceeded to nestle between his knees&mdash;an old
trick of hers&mdash;and once more taking his hand, stroked it
between her brown fingers, looked up into his face, and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dear old Gabe!"</p>

<p>The sudden smile that irradiated Gabriel's serious face
would have been even worse provocation to Mrs. Conroy
than his previous conduct.</p>

<p>"What was the matter, Gabe?" said Olly; "what was
she saying when we came in?"</p>

<p>Gabriel had not, since the entrance of his sister, thought
of Mrs. Conroy's parting speech and manner. Even now
its full significance did not appear to have reached him.</p>

<p>"I disremember, Olly," he replied, looking down into
Olly's earnest eyes, "suthin' or other; she was techy, thet's
all."</p>

<p>"But wot did she mean by saying that the house and
lands was hers?" persisted the child.</p>

<p>"Married folks, Olly," said Gabriel, with the lazy, easy
manner of vast matrimonial experience, "married folks hev<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
little jokes and ways o' thar own. Bein' onmarried yourself,
ye don't know. 'With all my worldly goods I thee
endow,' thet's all&mdash;thet's what she meant, Olly. 'With all
my worldly goods I thee endow.' Did you hev a good time
down there?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Olly.</p>

<p>"You'll hev a nice time here soon, Olly," said Gabriel.</p>

<p>Olly looked incredulously across the hall toward the door
of Mrs. Conroy's chamber.</p>

<p>"Thet's it, Olly," said Gabriel, "Mrs. Conroy's goin' to
'Frisco to see some friends. She's thet bent on goin' thet
nothin' 'il stop her. Ye see, Olly, it's the fashion fur new
married folks to kinder go way and visit absent and
sufferin' friends. Thar's them little ways about the married
state, that, bein' onmarried yourself, you don't sabe. But
it's all right, she's goin'. Bein' a lady, and raised, so to
speak, 'mong fashi'n'ble people, she's got to folly the
fashin. She's goin' for three months, mebbe four. I disremember
now wot's the fashi'n'ble time. But she'll do it,
Olly."</p>

<p>Olly cast a penetrating look at her brother.</p>

<p>"She ain't goin' on my account, Gabe?"</p>

<p>"Lord love the child, no! Wot put thet into your
head, Olly? Why," said Gabriel with cheerful mendacity,
"she's been takin' a shine to ye o' late. On'y to-night
she was wonderin' whar you be."</p>

<p>As if to give credence to his words, and much to his inward
astonishment, the door of Mrs. Conroy's room opened,
and the lady herself, with a gracious smile on her lips and
a brightly beaming eye, albeit somewhat reddened around
the lids, crossed the hall, and, going up to Olly, kissed her
round cheek.</p>

<p>"I thought it was your voice, and although I was just
going to bed," she added gaily, with a slightly apologetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
look at her charming dishabille, "I had to come in and be
sure it was you. And where have you been, you naughty
girl? Do you know I shall be dreadfully jealous of this
Mrs. Markle. Come and tell me all about her. Come.
You shall stay with me to-night and we won't let brother
Gabe hear our little secrets&mdash;shall we? Come!"</p>

<p>And before the awe-struck Gabriel could believe his own
senses she had actually whisked the half-pleased, half-frightened
child into her own room, and he was left standing
alone. Nor was he the less amazed, although relieved of a
certain undefined anxiety for the child, when, a moment
later, Olly herself thrust her curly head out of the door, and,
calling out, "Good-night, old Gabe," with a mischievous
accent, shut and locked the door in his face. For a
moment Gabriel stood petrified on his own hearthstone.
Was he mistaken, and had Mrs. Conroy's anger actually
been nothing but a joke? Was Olly really sincere in her
dislike of his wife? There was but one apparent solution
to these various and perplexing problems, and that was the
general incomprehensibility of the sex.</p>

<p>"The ways o' woman is awful onsartin," said Gabriel, as
he sought the solitary little room which had been set apart
for Olly, "and somehow I ain't the man ez hez the gift o'
findin' them out."</p>

<p>And with these reflections he went apologetically, yet, to
a certain extent, contentedly, as was his usual habit, to bed.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

<h5>IN WHICH THE TREASURE IS FOUND&mdash;AND LOST.</h5>


<p>As no word has been handed down of the conversation
that night between Olly and her sister-in-law, I fear the
masculine reader must view their subsequent conduct in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
the light of Gabriel's abstract proportion. The feminine
reader&mdash;to whose well-known sense of justice and readiness
to acknowledge a characteristic weakness, I chiefly commend
these pages&mdash;will of course require no further explanation,
and will be quite ready to believe that the next morning
Olly and Mrs. Conroy were apparently firm friends, and
that Gabriel was incontinently snubbed by both of these
ladies as he deserved.</p>

<p>"You don't treat July right," said Olly, one morning, to
Gabriel, during five minutes that she had snatched from
the inseparable company of Mrs. Conroy.</p>

<p>Gabriel opened his eyes in wonder. "I hain't been
'round the house much, because I allowed you and July
didn't want my kempany," he began apologetically, "and
ef it's shortness of provisions, I've fooled away so much
time, Olly, in prospectin' that ledge that I had no time to
clar up and get any dust. I reckon, may be the pork
bar'l <i>is</i> low. But I'll fix thet straight soon, Olly, soon."</p>

<p>"But it ain't thet, Gabe&mdash;it ain't provisions&mdash;it's&mdash;it's&mdash;O!
you ain't got no sabe ez a husband&mdash;thar!" burst out
the direct Olly at last.</p>

<p>Without the least sign of resentment, Gabriel looked
thoughtfully at his sister.</p>

<p>"Thet's so&mdash;I reckon thet <i>is</i> the thing. Not hevin'
been married afore, and bein', so to speak, strange and
green-handed, like as not I don't exactly come up to the
views of a woman ez hez hed thet experience. And her
husband a savang! a savang! Olly, and a larned man."</p>

<p>"You're as good as him!" ejaculated Olly, hastily,
whose parts of speech were less accurately placed than her
feelings, "and I reckon she loves you a heap better, Gabe.
But you ain't quite lovin' enough," she added, as Gabriel
started. "Why, thar was thet young couple thet came up
from Simpson's last week, and stayed over at Mrs. Markle's.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
Thar was no end of the attentions thet thet man paid to
thet thar woman&mdash;fixin' her shawl, histin' the winder and
puttin' it down, and askin' after her health every five
minnits&mdash;and they'd sit and sit, just like this,"&mdash;&mdash;here Olly,
in the interests of domestic felicity, improvised the favourite
attitude of the bridegroom, as far as the great girth of
Gabriel's waist and chest could be "clipped" by her small
arms.</p>

<p>"Wot! afore folks?" asked Gabriel, looking down a
little shamefully on the twining arms of his sister.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;in course&mdash;afore folks. Why, they want it to be
known thet they're married."</p>

<p>"Olly," broke out Gabriel desperately, "your sister-in-law
ain't thet kind of woman. She'd reckon thet kind o'
thing was low."</p>

<p>But Olly only replied by casting a mischievous look at her
brother, shaking her curls, and with the mysterious admonition,
"Try it!" left him, and went back to Mrs. Conroy.</p>

<p>Happily for Gabriel, Mrs. Conroy did not offer an opportunity
for the exhibition of any tenderness on Gabriel's
part. Although she did not make any allusion to the past,
and even utterly ignored any previous quarrel, she still
preserved a certain coy demeanour toward him, that, while
it relieved him of an onerous duty, very greatly weakened
his faith in the infallibility of Olly's judgment. When, out
of respect to that judgment, he went so far as to throw his
arms ostentatiously around his wife's waist one Sunday,
while perambulating the single long public street of One
Horse Gulch, and that lady, with great decision, quietly
slipped out of his embrace, he doubted still more.</p>

<p>"I did it on account o' what you said, Olly, and darn my
skin if she seemed to like it at all, and even the boys
hangin' around seemed to think it was queer. Jo Hobson
snickered right out."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>"When was it?" said Olly.</p>

<p>"Sunday."</p>

<p>Olly, sharply&mdash;"Where?"</p>

<p>Gabriel&mdash;"On Main Street."</p>

<p>Olly, apostrophising heaven with her blue eyes&mdash;"Ef
thar ever was a blunderin' mule, Gabe, it's <span class="smcap">YOU</span>!"</p>

<p>Gabriel, mildly and thoughtfully&mdash;"Thet's so."</p>

<p>Howbeit, some kind of a hollow truce was patched up
between these three belligerents, and Mrs. Conroy did not
go to San Francisco on business. It is presumed that the
urgency of her affairs there was relieved by correspondence,
for during the next two weeks she expressed much anxiety
on the arrival of the regular tri-weekly mails. And one
day it brought her not only a letter, but an individual of
some importance in this history.</p>

<p>He got down from the Wingdam coach amid considerable
local enthusiasm. Apart from the fact that it was
well known that he was a rich San Francisco banker and
capitalist, his brusque, sharp energy, his easy, sceptical
familiarity and general contempt for and ignoring of everything
but the practical and material, and, above all, his
reputation for success, which seemed to make that success
a wholesome business principal rather than good fortune,
had already fascinated the passengers who had listened to
his curt speech and half oracular axioms. They had forgiven
dogmatisms voiced in such a hearty manner, and
emphasised possibly with a slap on the back of the listener.
He had already converted them to his broad materialism&mdash;less,
perhaps, by his curt rhetoric than by the logic of his
habitual business success, and the respectability that it
commanded. It was easy to accept scepticism from a
man who evidently had not suffered by it. Radicalism
and democracy are much more fascinating to us when the
apostle is in comfortable case and easy circumstances, than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
when he is clad in fustian, and consistently out of a situation.
Human nature thirsts for the fruit of the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil, but would prefer to receive it
from the happy owner of a latch-key to the Garden of
Eden, rather than from the pilferer who had just been
ejected from the premises.</p>

<p>It is probable, however, that the possessor of these
admirable qualities had none of that fine scorn for a mankind
accessible to this weakness which at present fills the
breast of the writer, and, I trust, the reader, of these pages.
If he had, I doubt if he would have been successful. Like
a true hero, he was quite unconscious of the quality of his
heroism, and utterly unable to analyse it. So that, without
any previous calculations or pre-arranged plan, he managed
to get rid of his admirers, and apply himself to the business
he had in hand without either wilfully misleading the public
of One Horse Gulch, or giving the slightest intimation of
what that real business was. That the general interests of
One Horse Gulch had attracted the attention of this powerful
capitalist&mdash;that he intended to erect a new Hotel, or
"start" an independent line of stage-coaches from Sacramento,
were among the accepted theories. Everybody
offered him vast and gratuitous information, and out of
the various facts and theories submitted to him he gained
the particular knowledge he required without asking for it.
Given a reputation for business shrewdness and omnipresence
in any one individual, and the world will speedily
place him beyond the necessity of using them.</p>

<p>And so in a casual, general way, the stranger was shown
over the length and breadth and thickness and present
and future of One Horse Gulch. When he had reached
the farther extremity of the Gulch he turned to his escort&mdash;"I'll
make the inquiry you ask now."</p>

<p>"How?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>"By telegraph&mdash;if you'll take it."</p>

<p>He tore a leaf from a memorandum-book and wrote a
few lines.</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll look around here&mdash;I suppose there's not much
beyond this?"</p>

<p>"No; the next claim is Gabriel Conroy's."</p>

<p>"Not much account, I reckon?"</p>

<p>"No? It pays him grub!"</p>

<p>"Well, dine with me at three o'clock, when and where
you choose&mdash;you know best. Invite whom you like.
Good-bye!" And the great man's escort, thus dismissed,
departed, lost in admiration of the decisive promptitude
and liberality of his guest.</p>

<p>Left to himself, the stranger turned his footsteps in the
direction of Gabriel Conroy's claim. Had he been an
admirer of Nature, or accessible to any of those influences
which a contemplation of wild scenery is apt to produce in
weaker humanity, he would have been awed by the gradual
transition of a pastoral landscape to one of uncouth heroics.
In a few minutes he had left the belt of sheltering pines
and entered upon the ascent of a shadowless, scorched,
and blistered mountain, that here and there in places of
vegetation had put on the excrescences of scoria, or a
singular eruption of crust, that, breaking beneath his feet
in slippery grey powder, made his footing difficult and
uncertain. Had he been possessed of a scientific eye, he
would have noted here and there the evidences of volcanic
action, in the sudden depressions, the abrupt elevations,
the marks of disruption and upheaval, and the river-like
flow of débris that protruded a black tongue into the valley
below. But I am constrained to believe the stranger's
dominant impression was simply one of heat. Half-way
up the ascent he took off his coat and wiped his forehead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
with his handkerchief. Nevertheless, certain peculiarities
in his modes of progression showed him to be not unfamiliar
with mountain travel. Two or three times during
the ascent he stopped, and, facing about, carefully resurveyed
the path beneath him. Slight as was the action,
it was the unfailing sign of the mountaineer, who recognised
that the other side of the mountain was as yet an undetermined
quantity, and was prepared to retrace his steps if
necessary. At the summit he paused and looked around
him.</p>

<p>Immediately at his feet the Gulch which gave its name
to the settlement, and from which the golden harvest was
gathered, broadened into a thickly wooded valley. Its
quivering depths were suffused by the incense of odorous
gums and balms liberated by the fierce heat of the noonday
sun that rose to his face in soft, tremulous waves, and filled
the air with its heated spices. Through a gap in the cañon
to the west, a faint, scarcely-distinguishable line of cloud
indicated the coast range. North and south, higher hills
arose heavily terraced with straight colonnades of pines,
that made the vast black monolith on which he stood
appear blacker and barer by contrast. Higher hills to
the east&mdash;one or two peaks&mdash;and between them in the
sunlight odd-looking, indistinct, vacant intervals&mdash;blanks
in the landscape as yet not filled in with colour or expression.
Yet the stranger knew them to be snow, and for a
few moments seemed fascinated&mdash;gazing at them with a
fixed eye and rigid mouth, until, with an effort, he tore
himself away.</p>

<p>Scattered over the summit were numerous holes that
appeared to have been recently sunk. In one of them
the stranger picked up a fragment of the crumbled rock, and
examined it carelessly. Then he slowly descended the
gentler slope towards the west, in the direction of a claim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
wherein his quick eye had discovered a man at work. A
walk of a few moments brought him to the bank of red clay,
the heap of tailings, the wooden sluice-box, and the pan
and shovel which constituted the appurtenances of an ordinary
claim. As he approached nearer, the workman rose
from the bank over which he was bending, and leaning on
his pick, turned his face to the new-comer. His broad,
athletic figure, his heavy blonde beard, and serious, perplexed
eyes, were unmistakable. It was Gabriel Conroy.</p>

<p>"How are ye?" said the stranger, briskly extending a
hand, which Gabriel took mechanically. "You're looking
well! Recollect <i>you</i>, but you don't recollect me. Eh?"
He laughed curtly, in a fashion as short and business-like
as his speech, and then fixed his eyes rather impatiently on
the hesitating Gabriel.</p>

<p>Gabriel could only stare, and struggle with a tide of thick-coming
remembrances. He looked around him; the sun was
beating down on the old familiar objects, everything was
unchanged&mdash;and yet this face, this voice.</p>

<p>"I am here on a matter of business," continued the
stranger briskly, dismissing the question of recognition as
one unessential to the business on hand&mdash;"and&mdash;what have
you got to propose?" He leaned lightly against the bank
and supported himself by thrusting Gabriel's pickaxe
against the bank, as he waited a reply.</p>

<p>"It's Peter Dumphy," said Gabriel, in a awe-stricken
voice.</p>

<p>"Yes. You recollect me now! Thought you would.
It's five years and over&mdash;ain't it? Rough times them,
Gabriel&mdash;warn't they? Eh! But <i>you're</i> lookin' well&mdash;doin'
well, too. Hey? Well&mdash;what do you propose to do about
this claim? Haven't made up your mind&mdash;hey? Come
then&mdash;I'll make a proposition. First, I suppose your title's
all right, hey?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>It was so evident from Gabriel's dazed manner that,
apart from his astonishment at meeting Peter Dumphy,
he did not know what he was talking about, that Dumphy
paused.</p>

<p>"It's about these specimens," he added, eyeing Gabriel
keenly, "the specimens you sent me."</p>

<p>"Wot specimens?" said Gabriel vaguely, still lost in the
past.</p>

<p>"The ones your wife sent me&mdash;all the same thing, you
know."</p>

<p>"But it ain't," said Gabriel, with his old truthful directness.
"You better talk to her 'bout thet. Thet's her look-out.
I reckon now she <i>did</i> say suthin'," continued Gabriel,
meditatively, "about sendin' rock to Frisco to be tested,
but I didn't somehow get to take an interest in it. Leastways,
it's her funeral. You'd better see her."</p>

<p>It was Mr. Dumphy's turn to be perplexed. In his perfect
misapprehension of the character of the man before him, he
saw only skilful business evasion under the guise of simplicity.
He remembered, moreover, that in the earlier days
of his prosperity as Dumphy and Jenkins, Commission
Merchants, he was himself in the habit of referring customers
with whom he was not ready to treat, to Jenkins, very much
as he had just now been referred to Mrs. Conroy.</p>

<p>"Of course," he said briskly; "only I thought I'd save
time, which is short with me to-day, by coming directly to
you. May not have time to see her. But you can write."</p>

<p>"Thet's so," said Gabriel, "p'r'aps it's just as well in the
long run. Ef ye don't see her, she'll know it ain't your
fault. I'll let on that much to her." And having disposed
of this unimportant feature of the interview, he continued,
"Ye haven't heard nought o' Grace&mdash;ye mind Grace?
Dumphy!&mdash;a purty little girl ez was with me up thar. Ye ain't
heerd anything o' her&mdash;nor seen her, may be&mdash;hev you?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course this question at such a moment was to Mr.
Dumphy susceptible of only one meaning. It was that
Mrs. Conroy had confessed everything to Gabriel, and that
he wished to use Dumphy's complicity in the deceit as a
lever in future business transactions. Mr. Dumphy felt he
had to deal with two consummate actors&mdash;one of whom
was a natural hypocrite. For the first time in his life he
was impatient of evil. We never admire truth and sincerity
so highly as when we find it wanting in an adversary.</p>

<p>"Ran off with some fellow, didn't she? Yes, I remember.
You won't see her again. It's just as well for you!
I'd call her dead, anyway."</p>

<p>Although Dumphy was convinced that Gabriel's interest
in the fate of his sister was hypocritical, he was not above
a Christian hope that this might wound a brother's feelings.
He turned to go.</p>

<p>"Can't you come back this way and hev a little talk
about ol' times?" said Gabriel, warming toward Dumphy
under the magic of old associations, and ignoring with
provoking unconsciousness the sting of his last speech.
"There's Olly ez 'ud jest admire to see ye. Ye mind
Olly?&mdash;the baby, Grace's little sister, growed a fine likely
gal now. See yer," continued Gabriel with sudden energy,
putting down his pick and shovel, "I'll jess go over thar
with ye now."</p>

<p>"No! no!" said Dumphy quickly. "Busy! Can't!
'Nother time! Good-day; see you again some time. So
long!" and he hurriedly departed, retracing his steps until the
claim and its possessor were lost in the intervening foliage.</p>

<p>Then he paused, hesitated, and then striking across the
summit of the hill, made his way boldly to Gabriel's
cottage.</p>

<p>Either Mrs. Conroy was expecting him, or had detected
him coming through the woods, for she opened the door to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
him and took him into her little parlour with a graciousness
of demeanour and an elaboration of toilet that would have
been dangerous to any other man. But, like most men
with a deservedly bad reputation among women, Mr.
Dumphy always rigidly separated any weakness of gallantly
from his business.</p>

<p>"Here only for a few moments. Sorry can't stay longer.
You're looking well!" said Mr. Dumphy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Conroy said she had not expected the pleasure of a
personal interview; Mr. Dumphy must be <i>so</i> busy always.</p>

<p>"Yes. But I like to bring good news myself. The
specimens you sent have been assayed by first-class, reliable
men. They'll do. No gold&mdash;but eighty per cent silver.
Hey! P'r'aps you expected it."</p>

<p>But Mr. Dumphy could see plainly from Mrs. Conroy's
eager face that she had not expected it.</p>

<p>"Silver," she gasped&mdash;"eighty per cent!"</p>

<p>He was mystified, but relieved. It was evident that she
had not consulted anybody else, and that he was first on
the ground. So he said curtly&mdash;</p>

<p>"What do you propose?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," began the lady. "I haven't thought"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Exactly!" interrupted Dumphy. "Haven't got any
proposition. Excuse me&mdash;but" (taking out his watch)
"time's nearly up. Look here. Eighty per cent's big
thing! But silver mine takes gold mine to run it. All
expense first&mdash;no profit till you get down. Works, smelting&mdash;cost
twenty per cent. Here's my proposition. Put
whole thing in joint-stock company; 100 shares; five
millions capital. You take fifty shares. I'll take twenty-five&mdash;dispose
of other twenty-five as I can. How's that?
Hey? You can't say! Well&mdash;think of it!"</p>

<p>But all Mrs. Conroy could think of was two and a half
millions! It stared at her, stretching its gigantic ciphers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
across the room. It blazed in golden letters on cheques,&mdash;it
rose on glittering piles of silver coin to the ceiling of
the parlour. Yet she turned to him with a haggard face,
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"But this&mdash;this money&mdash;is only in prospective."</p>

<p>"Cash your draft for the sum ten minutes after the
stock's issued. That's business."</p>

<p>With this certainty Mrs. Conroy recovered herself.</p>

<p>"I will talk&mdash;with&mdash;my husband," she said.</p>

<p>Mr. Dumphy smiled&mdash;palpably, openly, and shamelessly.
Mrs. Conroy coloured quickly, but not from the consciousness
Mr. Dumphy attributed to her, of detected cunning.
She had begun to be ashamed of the position she believed
she occupied in this man's eyes, and fearful that he should
have discovered her husband's indifference to her.</p>

<p>"I've already seen him," said Mr. Dumphy quietly.</p>

<p>The colour dropped from Mrs. Conroy's cheeks.</p>

<p>"He knows nothing of this," she said faintly.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Dumphy half contemptuously, "he
said so; referred to you. That's all right. That's business."</p>

<p>"You did not tell him&mdash;you dared not"&mdash;&mdash;she said
excitedly.</p>

<p>Mr. Dumphy looked curiously at her for a moment.
Then he rose and shut the door.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said, facing Mrs. Conroy in a hard,
matter-of-fact way, "do you mean to say that what that
man&mdash;your husband&mdash;said, was true? That he knows
nothing of you; of the circumstances under which you
came here?"</p>

<p>"He does not&mdash;I swear to God he does not," she said
passionately.</p>

<p>It was inexplicable, but Mr. Dumphy believed her.</p>

<p>"But how will you explain this to him? You can do
nothing without him."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why should <i>he</i> know more? If he has discovered this
mine, it is <i>his</i>&mdash;free of any gift of mine&mdash;as independent of
any claim of mine as if we were strangers. The law makes
him the owner of the mine that he discovers, no matter on
whose land it may be found. In personating his sister, I
only claimed a grant to the land. He has made the discovery
which gives it its value! Even that sister," she
added with a sudden flash in her eyes&mdash;"even that sister,
were she living, could not take it from him now!"</p>

<p>It was true! This woman, with whose weakness he
had played, had outwitted them all, and slipped through
their fingers almost without stain or blemish. And in a
way so simple! Duped as he had been, he could hardly
restrain his admiration, and said quite frankly and
heartily&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good&mdash;that's business!"</p>

<p>And then&mdash;ah me! this clever creature&mdash;this sharp
adventuress, this Anonyma Victrix began to cry, and to
beg him not to tell <i>her husband</i>!</p>

<p>At this familiar sign of the universal feminine weakness,
Dumphy picked up his ears and arts again.</p>

<p>"Where's your proof that your husband is the first discoverer?"
he said curtly, but not unkindly. "Won't that
paper that Dr. Devarges gave his sister show that the
doctor was really the discoverer of this lead?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but Dr. Devarges is dead, and I hold the paper."</p>

<p>"Good!" He took out his watch. "I've five minutes
more. Now look here. I'm not going to say that you
haven't managed this thing well&mdash;you have!&mdash;and that you
can, if you like, get along without me&mdash;you can! See!
I'm not going to say that I went into this thing without
the prospect of making something out of it myself. I
have! That's business. The thing for you to consider
now is this: understanding each other as we do, couldn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
you push this thing through better with my help&mdash;and
helping me&mdash;than to go elsewhere! Understand me!
You could find a dozen men in San Francisco who would
make you as good an offer and better! But it wouldn't be
to their interest to keep down any unpleasant reminders
of the past as it would be mine. You understand?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Conroy replied by extending her hand.</p>

<p>"To keep my secret from every one&mdash;from <i>him</i>," she
said earnestly.</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;<i>that's</i> business."</p>

<p>Then these two artful ones shook hands with a heartfelt
and loyal admiration and belief for each other that I fear
more honest folks might have profited by, and Mr. Dumphy
went off to dine.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Conroy closed the front door, Olly came running
in from the back piazza. Mrs. Conroy caught her in her
arms and discharged her pent-up feelings, and, let us hope,
her penitence, in a joyful and passionate embrace. But
Olly struggled to extricate herself. When at last she got
her head free, she said angrily&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let me go. I want to see him."</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;Mr. Dumphy?" asked Mrs. Conroy, still holding
the child, with a half-hysterical laugh.</p>

<p>"Yes. Gabe said he was here. Let me go, I say!"</p>

<p>"What do you want with him?" asked her captor with
shrill gaiety.</p>

<p>"Gabe says&mdash;Gabe says&mdash;let me go, will you? Gabe
says he knew"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whom?"</p>

<p>"My dear, dear sister Grace! There! I didn't mean
to hurt you&mdash;but I must go!"</p>

<p>And she did, leaving the prospective possessor of two
and a half millions, vexed, suspicious, and alone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

<h5>MR. DUMPHY MEETS AN OLD FRIEND.</h5>


<p>Peter Dumphy was true to his client. A few days after
he had returned to San Francisco he dispatched a note
to Victor, asking an interview. He had reasoned that,
although Victor was vanquished and helpless regarding the
late discovery at One Horse Gulch, yet his complicity with
Mrs. Conroy's earlier deceit might make it advisable that
his recollection of that event should be effaced. He was
waiting a reply when a card was brought to him by a clerk.
Mr. Dumphy glanced at it impatiently, and read the name
of "Arthur Poinsett." Autocrat as Dumphy was in his own
counting house and business circle, the name was one of
such recognised power in California that he could not ignore
its claims to his attention. More than that, it represented
a certain respectability and social elevation which Dumphy,
with all his scepticism and democratic assertion, could not
with characteristic shrewdness afford to undervalue. He
said, "Show him in," without lifting his head from the
papers that lay upon his desk.</p>

<p>The door opened again to an elegant-looking young man,
who lounged carelessly into the awful presence without any
of that awe with which the habitual business visitors approached
Peter Dumphy. Indeed, it was possible that
never before had Mr. Dumphy's door opened to one who
was less affected by the great capitalist's reputation. Nevertheless,
with the natural ease of good breeding, after
depositing his hat on the table, he walked quietly to the
fireplace, and stood with his back toward it with courteous,
but perhaps too indifferent patience. Mr. Dumphy was at
last obliged to look up.</p>

<p>"Busy, I see," yawned Poinsett, with languid politeness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
"Don't let me disturb you. I thought your man said you
were disengaged. Must have made a mistake."</p>

<p>Mr. Dumphy was forced to lay aside his pen, and rise,
inwardly protesting.</p>

<p>"You don't know me by my card. I have the advantage,
I think," continued the young man with a smile, "even in
the mere memory of faces. The last time I saw you was&mdash;let
me see&mdash;five years ago. Yes! you were chewing a
scrap of buffalo hide to keep yourself from starving."</p>

<p>"Philip Ashley!" said Mr. Dumphy in a low voice,
looking hastily around, and drawing nearer the stranger.</p>

<p>"Precisely," returned Poinsett somewhat impatiently,
raising his own voice. "That was my <i>nom de guerre</i>. But
Dumphy seems to have been your real name after all."</p>

<p>If Dumphy had conceived any idea of embarrassing
Poinsett by the suggestion of an <i>alias</i> in his case, he
could have dismissed it after this half-contemptuous recognition
of his own proper cognomen. But he had no such
idea. In spite of his utmost effort he felt himself gradually
falling into the same relative position&mdash;the same humble
subordination he had accepted five years before. It was
useless to think of his wealth, of his power, of his surroundings.
Here in his own bank parlour he was submissively
waiting the will and pleasure of this stranger. He made
one more desperate attempt to regain his lost prestige.</p>

<p>"You have some business with me, eh? Poinsett!"
He commenced the sentence with a dignity, and ended it
with a familiarity equally inefficacious.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Poinsett carelessly, shifting his legs
before the fire. "Shouldn't have called otherwise on a
man of such affairs at such a time. You are interested, I
hear, in a mine recently discovered at One Horse Gulch on
the Rancho of the Blessed Innocents. One of my clients
holds a grant, not yet confirmed, to the Rancho."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who?" said Mr. Dumphy quickly.</p>

<p>"I believe that is not important nor essential for you to
know until we make a formal claim," returned Arthur
quietly, "but I don't mind satisfying your curiosity. It's
Miss Dolores Salvatierra."</p>

<p>Mr. Dumphy felt relieved, and began with gathering
courage and brusqueness, "That don't affect"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your mining claim; not in the least," interrupted Arthur
quietly, "I am not here to press or urge any rights that
we may have. We may not even submit the grant for
patent. But my client would like to know something of
the present tenants, or, if you will, owners. You represent
them, I think? A man and wife. The woman appears
first as a spinster, assuming to be a Miss Grace Conroy, to
whom an alleged transfer of an alleged grant was given.
She next appears as the wife of one Gabriel Conroy, who is,
I believe, an alleged brother of the alleged Miss Grace
Conroy. You'll admit, I think, it's a pretty mixed business,
and would make a pretty bad showing in court. But this
adjudicature we are not yet prepared to demand. What we
want to know is this&mdash;and I came to you, Dumphy, as the
man most able to tell us. Is the sister or the brother real&mdash;or
are they both impostors? Is there a legal marriage?
Of course <i>your</i> legal interest is not jeopardised in any event."</p>

<p>Mr. Dumphy partly regained his audacity.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> ought to know&mdash;<i>you</i> ran away with the real Grace
Conroy," he said, putting his hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>"Did I? Then this is not she, if I understand you.
Thanks! And the brother"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is Gabriel Conroy, if I know the man," said Dumphy
shortly, feeling that he had been entrapped into a tacit
admission. "But why don't you satisfy yourself?"</p>

<p>"You have been good enough to render it unnecessary,"
said Arthur, with a smile. "I do not doubt your word.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
I am, I trust, too much of a lawyer to doubt the witness I
myself have summoned. But who is this woman?"</p>

<p>"The widow of Dr. Devarges."</p>

<p>"The <i>real</i> thing?"</p>

<p>"Yes, unless Grace Conroy should lay claim to that
title and privilege. The old man seems to have been
pretty much divided in his property and affections."</p>

<p>The shaft did not apparently reach Arthur, for whom it
was probably intended. He only said, "Have you legal evidence that she <i>is</i> the widow? If it
were a fact, and a case of ill-treatment or hardship, why it
might abate the claim of my client, who is a rich woman,
and whose sympathies are of course in favour of the real
brother and real sister. By the way, there is another sister,
isn't there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a mere child."</p>

<p>"That's all. Thank you. I sha'n't trespass further upon
your time. Good-day."</p>

<p>He had taken up his hat and was moving toward the
door. Mr. Dumphy, who felt that whatever might have
been Poinsett's motives in this interview, he, Dumphy, had
certainly gained nothing, determined to retrieve himself, if
possible, by a stroke of audacity.</p>

<p>"One moment," he said, as Poinsett was carefully
settling his hat over his curls. "You know whether this
girl is living or not. What has become of her?"</p>

<p>"But I don't," returned Poinsett calmly, "or I shouldn't
come to <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>There was something about Poinsett's manner that
prevented Dumphy from putting him in the category of
"all men," that both in his haste and his deliberation Mr.
Dumphy was apt to say "were liars."</p>

<p>"When and where did you see her last?" he asked less
curtly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>"I left her at a hunter's cabin near the North Fork while
I went back for help. I was too late. A relief party from
the valley had already discovered the other dead. When
I returned for Grace she was gone&mdash;possibly with the relief
party. I always supposed it was the expedition that
succoured you."</p>

<p>There was a pause, in which these two scamps looked
at each other. It will be remembered that both had
deceived the relief party in reference to their connexions
with the unfortunate dead. Neither believed, however,
that the other was aware of the fact. But the inferior
scamp was afraid to ask another question that might disclose
his own falsehood; and the question which might
have been an embarrassing one to Arthur, and have
changed his attitude toward Dumphy, remained unasked.
Not knowing the reason of Dumphy's hesitation, Arthur
was satisfied of his ignorance, and was still left the master.
He nodded carelessly to Dumphy and withdrew.</p>

<p>As he left the room he brushed against a short, thick-set
man, who was entering at the same moment. Some
instinct of mutual repulsion caused the two men to look at
each other. Poinsett beheld a sallow face, that, in spite
of its belonging to a square figure, seemed to have a consumptive
look; a face whose jaw was narrow and whose
lips were always half-parted over white, large, and protruding
teeth; a mouth that apparently was always breathless&mdash;a
mouth that Mr. Poinsett remembered as the distinguishing
and unpleasant feature of some one vaguely known to
him professionally. As the mouth gasped and parted
further in recognition, Poinsett nodded carelessly in return,
and attributing his repulsion to that extraordinary feature
thought no more about it.</p>

<p>Not so the new-comer. He glanced suspiciously after
Arthur and then at Mr. Dumphy. The latter, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
recovered his presence of mind and his old audacity,
turned them instantly upon him.</p>

<p>"Well! What have you got to propose?" he said,
with his usual curt formula.</p>

<p>"It is you have something to say; you sent for <i>me</i>,"
said his visitor.</p>

<p>"Yes. You left me to find out that there was another
grant to that mine. What does all this mean, Ramirez?"</p>

<p>Victor raised his eyes and yellow fringes to the ceiling,
and said, with a shrug&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Quien sabe?</i> there are grants and grants!"</p>

<p>"So it seems. But I suppose you know that we have a
title now better than any grant&mdash;a mineral discovery."</p>

<p>Victor bowed and answered with his teeth, "<i>We</i>, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am getting up a company for her husband."</p>

<p>"Her husband&mdash;good!"</p>

<p>Dumphy looked at his accomplice keenly. There was
something in Victor's manner that was vaguely suspicious.
Dumphy, who was one of those men to whose courage the
habit of success in all things was essential, had been a
little shaken by his signal defeat in his interview with
Poinsett, and now became irritable.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;her husband. What have you got to propose
about it, eh? Nothing? Well, look here, I sent for you
to say that as everything now is legal and square, you
might as well dry up in regard to her former relations or
your first scheme. You sabe?" Dumphy became slangy
as he lost his self-control. "You are to know nothing
about Miss Grace Conroy."</p>

<p>"And there is no more any sister, eh&mdash;only a wife?"</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"So."</p>

<p>"You will of course get something for these preliminary
steps of yours, although you understand they have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
useless, and that your claim is virtually dead. You are, in
fact, in no way connected with her present success. Unless&mdash;unless,"
added Dumphy, with a gratuitous malice
that defeat had engendered, "unless you expect something
for having been the means of making a match between her
and Gabriel."</p>

<p>Victor turned a little more yellow in the thin line over
his teeth. "Ha! ha! good&mdash;a joke," he laughed. "No,
I make no charge to you for that; not even to you. No&mdash;ha!
ha!" At the same moment had Mr. Dumphy
known what was passing in his mind he would have probably
moved a little nearer the door of his counting-room.</p>

<p>"There's nothing we can pay you for but silence. We
may as well understand each other regarding that. That's
your interest; it's ours only so far as Mrs. Conroy's social
standing is concerned, for I warn you that exposure might
seriously compromise you in a business way, while it
would not hurt us. I could get the value of Gabriel's
claim to the mine advanced to-morrow, if the whole story
were known to-night. If you remember, the only evidence
of a previous discovery exists in a paper in our possession.
Perhaps we pay you for that. Consider it so, if you like.
Consider also that any attempt to get hold of it legally or
otherwise would end in its destruction. Well, what do
you say? All right. When the stock is issued I'll write
you a cheque: or perhaps you'd take a share of stock?"</p>

<p>"I would prefer the money," said Victor, with a peculiar
laugh.</p>

<p>Dumphy affected to take no notice of the sarcasm.
"Your head is level, Victor," he said, returning to his
papers. "Don't meddle with stocks. Good day!"</p>

<p>Victor moved toward the door. "By the way, Victor,"
said Dumphy, looking up, calmly, "if you know the owner
of this lately discovered grant, you might intimate that any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
litigation wouldn't pay. That's what I told their counsel a
moment ago."</p>

<p>"Poinsett?" asked Victor, pausing, with his hand on
the door.</p>

<p>"Yes! But as he also happens to be Philip Ashley&mdash;the
chap who ran off with Grace Conroy, you had better
go and see him. Perhaps he can help you better than I.
Good day."</p>

<p>And, turning from the petrified Victor, Mr. Dumphy,
conscious that he had fully regained his prestige, rang his
bell to admit the next visitor.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>

<h5>MR. JACK HAMLIN TAKES A HOLIDAY.</h5>


<p>For some weeks Mr. Hamlin had not been well, or, as he
more happily expressed it, had been "off colour." The
celebrated Dr. Duchesne, an ex-army surgeon, after a careful
diagnosis, had made several inquiries of Jack, in a frank
way that delighted Mr. Hamlin, and then had said very
quietly&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are not doing justice to your profession, Jack.
Your pulse is 75, and that won't do for a man who habitually
deals faro. Been doing pretty well lately, and having a
good time, eh? I thought so! You've been running too
fast, and under too high pressure. You must take these
weights off the safely valve, Jack&mdash;better take the blower
down altogether. Bank your fires and run on half steam.
For the next two months I shall run you. You must live
like a Christian." Noticing the horror of Jack's face, he
added hastily, "I mean go to bed before midnight, get up
before you want to, eat more and drink less, don't play
to win, bore yourself thoroughly, and by that time I'll be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
able to put you back at that table as strong and cool as
ever. You used to sing, Jack; sit down at the piano and
give me a taste of your quality. * * * There, that'll do; I
thought so! You're out of practice and voice. Do that
every day, for a week, and it will come easier. I haven't
seen you stop and talk to a child for a month. What's
become of that little boot-black that you used to bedevil?
I've a devilish good mind to send you to a foundling hospital
for the good of the babies and yourself. Find out some
poor ranchero with a dozen children, and teach 'em singing.
Don't mind what you eat, as long as you eat regularly. I'd
have more hopes of you, Jack, if I'd dragged you out of Starvation
Camp, in the Sierras, as I did a poor fellow six years
ago, than finding you here in these luxurious quarters. Come!
Do as I say, and I'll stop that weariness, dissipate that
giddiness, get rid of that pain, lower that pulse, and put
you back where you were. I don't like your looks, Jack,
at all. I'd buck against any bank you ran, all night."</p>

<p>From which the intelligent reader will, I hope and trust,
perceive that this popular doctor's ideas of propriety resided
wholly in his intentions. With the abstract morality of
Hamlin's profession as a gambler he did not meddle; with
his competency to practise that profession only was he
concerned. Indeed, so frank was he in his expression, that
a few days later he remarked to a popular clergyman, "I
must put you under the same treatment as I did Jack
Hamlin&mdash;do you know him?&mdash;a gambler and a capital
fellow; you remind me of him. Same kind of trouble&mdash;cured
him as I will you." And he did.</p>

<p>The result of which advice was that in two weeks Mr.
Jack Hamlin found himself dreadfully bored and <i>ennuyé</i>,
but loyal to his trust with his physician, wandering in the
lower coast counties. At San Luis Rey, he attended a
bull-fight, and was sorely tempted to back the bull heavily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
and even conceived the idea of introducing a grizzly bear,
taking all the odds himself, but remembered his promise,
and fled the fascination. And so the next day, in a queer
old-fashioned diligence, he crossed the coast range, and
drifted into the quiet Mission of San Antonio. Here he
was so done up and bored with the journey and the
unpromising aspect of the town, that he quietly yielded his
usual profane badinage of the landlord to his loyal henchman
and negro body-servant, "Pete," and went to bed at
the solitary "Fonda," in the usual flea-infested bedroom of
the Spanish California inn.</p>

<p>"What does she look like, Pete?" said Jack, languidly.</p>

<p>Pete, who was familiar with his master's peculiarities of
speech, knew that the feminine pronoun referred to the
town, and responded with great gravity&mdash;</p>

<p>"De fac' is, Mahs Jack, dah don't peah to be much show
heah foh you. Deys playin' three-card monte in the bah
room, but 'taint no squar game. It 'ud do you no good,
it might jess rile you. Deys a fass pinto hoss hitched to a
poss in de yard&mdash;a hoss dat de owner don't seem to understand
nohow. If you was right smart agin, I might let you
go down thar and get a bet outer some o' dem Greasers.
But 'twon't do nohow. Deys a kind o' school&mdash;Sunday-school,
I reckon&mdash;nex doah. Lots o' little children saying
prayers, singin' and praisin' de Lord, sah."</p>

<p>"What day is this?" asked Jack, with sudden trepidation.</p>

<p>"Sunday, sah."</p>

<p>Jack uttered a plaintive groan and rolled over.</p>

<p>"Give one of these children a quarter, and tell him there's
another quarter waiting for him up here."</p>

<p>"You won't get no child to fool wid dis day, Mahs Jack,
shuah. Deys bound to get licked when dey goes. Folks
is mighty hard on dem boys, Sunday, sah; and it's de Lord's
day, Mahs Jack."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>Partly for the sake of horrifying his attendant, who notwithstanding
his evil associations was very devout, Jack
gave way to violent denunciation of any system of theology
that withheld children from romping with him any day he
might select.</p>

<p>"Open that window," he groaned, finally, "and shove
the bed alongside of it. That'll do. Hand me that novel.
You needn't read to me to-day; you can finish that
Volney's 'Ruins' another time."</p>

<p>It may be remarked here that it had been Jack's invalid
habit to get Pete to read to him. As he had provided
himself with such books as were objectionable to Pete, as
they were always utterly incomprehensible when filtered
through his dialect, and as he always made the reader
repeat the more difficult words, he extracted from this diversion
a delicious enjoyment, which Pete never suspected.</p>

<p>"You can go now," he said, when Pete had arranged
him comfortably. "I shan't want you this afternoon.
Take some money. I reckon you won't find any church
of your kind here, but if anybody interferes with you, jest
lambaste him! If you can't do it, jest spot him, and <i>I</i>
will!" (Mr. Hamlin never allowed anybody but himself
to object to his follower's religious tendencies.) "Have a
good time, Pete! Don't tangle yourself up if you can
help it. The liquor about here is jest pizen."</p>

<p>With this parting adjuration Mr. Hamlin turned over
and tried to devote himself to his book. But after reading
a few lines the letters somehow got blurred and indistinct,
and he was obliged to put the book down with a much
graver recollection of the doctor's warning than he had
ever had before. He was obliged to confess to a singular
weariness and lassitude that had become habitual, and to
admit that he had more pain at times than&mdash;as he put it&mdash;"a
man ought to have." The idea of his becoming blind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
or paralysed dawned upon him gradually, at first humorously;
wondering if he couldn't deal faro as well without
the use of his legs, for instance, which were of no account
to a man under the table; if there could not be raised
cards for the blind as well as raised letters. The idea of
feeling a "pair" or a "flush" amused him greatly, and
then he remembered more gravely poor Gordon, who,
becoming gradually paralysed, blew his brains out. "The
best thing he could do," he soliloquised, seriously. The
reflection, however, had left such a depressing effect upon
his mind that the exaltation of liquor for a moment seemed
to be the proper thing for him; but the next moment,
remembering his promise to the doctor, he changed his
mind, and&mdash;with an effort&mdash;his reflections.</p>

<p>For relief he turned his paling face to the window. It
gave upon a dusty courtyard, the soil of which was pulverised
by the pawing of countless hoofs during the long,
dry summer; upon a tiled roof that rose above an adobe
wall, over which again rose the two square whitewashed
towers of the Mission church. Between these towers he
caught a glimpse of dark green foliage, and beyond this
the shining sea.</p>

<p>It was very hot and dry. Scarcely a wave of air stirred
the curtains of the window. That afternoon the trade-winds
which usually harried and bullied the little Mission
of San Antonio did not blow, and a writhing weeping
willow near the window, that whipped itself into trifling
hysterics on the slightest pretext, was surprised into a stony
silence. Even the sea beyond glittered and was breathless.
It reminded Jack of the mouth of the man he met in
Sacramento at the hotel, and again had quarrelled with in
San Francisco. And there, absolutely, was the man, the
very man, gazing up at the hotel from the shadows of the
courtyard. Jack was instantly and illogically furious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
Had Pete been there he would at once have sent an
insulting message; but, while he was looking at him, a
sound rose upon the air which more pleasantly arrested
his attention.</p>

<p>It was an organ. Not a very fine instrument, nor skilfully
played; but an instrument that Jack was passionately
fond of. I forgot to say that he had once occupied the
position of organist in the Second Presbyterian Church of
Sacramento, until a growing and more healthy public
sentiment detected an incongruity between his secular and
Sunday occupations, and a prominent deacon, a successful
liquor-dealer, demanded his resignation. Although he
afterwards changed his attentions to a piano, he never
entirely lost his old affections. To become the possessor
of a large organ, to introduce it gradually, educating the
public taste, as a special feature of a first-class gambling
saloon, had always been one of Jack's wildest ambitions.
So he raised himself upon his elbow and listened. He
could see also that the adjacent building was really a
recent addition to the old Mission church, and that what
appeared to be a recess in the wall was only a deeply
embrasured window. Presently a choir of fresh young
voices joined the organ. Mr. Hamlin listened more
attentively; it was one of Mozart's masses with which he
was familiar.</p>

<p>For a few moments he forgot his pain and lassitude, and
lying there hummed in unison. And then, like a true
enthusiast, unmindful of his surroundings, he lifted his
voice&mdash;a very touching tenor, well known among his friends&mdash;and
joined in, drowning, I fear, the feebler pipe of the
little acolytes within. Indeed, it was a fine sight to see
this sentimental scamp, lying sick nigh unto dissolution
through a dissipated life and infamous profession, down
upon his back in the dingy <i>cuarto</i> of a cheap Spanish inn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
voicing the litanies of the Virgin. Howbeit, once started in
he sang it through, and only paused when the antiphonal
voices and organ ceased. Then he lifted his head, and,
leaning on his elbow, looked across the courtyard. He
had hoped for the appearance of some of the little singers,
and had all ready a handful of coin to throw to them, and
a few of those ingenious epithets and persuasive arguments
by which he had always been successful with the young.
But he was disappointed.</p>

<p>"I reckon school ain't out yet," he said to himself, and
was about to lie down again, when a face suddenly appeared
at the grating of the narrow window.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamlin as suddenly became breathless, and the
colour rose to his pale face. He was very susceptible to
female beauty, and the face that appeared at the grating
was that of a very beautiful Indian girl. He thought, and
was ready to swear, that he had never seen anything half
so lovely. Framed in the recess of the embrasure as a
shrine, it might have been a shadowed devotional image,
but that the face was not so angelically beautiful as it was
femininely fascinating, and that the large deeply fringed
eyes had an expression of bright impatience and human
curiosity. From his secure vantage behind the curtain
Mr. Hamlin knew that he could not be seen, and so lay
and absorbed this lovely bronze apparition which his voice
seemed to have evoked from the cold bronze adobe wall.
And then, as suddenly, she was gone, and the staring sunlight
and glittering sea beyond seemed to Mr. Hamlin to
have gone too.</p>

<p>When Pete returned at sunset, he was amazed and
alarmed to find his master dressed and sitting by the
window. There was a certain brightness in his eye and
an unwonted colour in his cheek that alarmed him still
more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>"You ain't bin and gone done nuffin' agin de doctor's
orders, Mahs Jack?" he began.</p>

<p>"You'll find the whisky flask all right, unless you've been
dippin' into it, you infernal old hypocrite," responded Jack,
cheerfully, accepting the implied suspicion of his servant.
"I've dressed myself because I'm goin' to church to-night,
to find out where you get your liquor. I'm happy because
I'm virtuous. Trot out that Volney's 'Ruins,' and wade
in. You're gettin' out o' practice, Pete. Stop. Because
you're religious, do you expect me to starve? Go and
order supper first! Stop. Where in blank are you going?
Here, you've been gone three hours on an errand for me,
and if you ain't runnin' off without a word about it."</p>

<p>"Gone on an errand foh you, sah?" gasped the astonished
Pete.</p>

<p>"Yes! Didn't I tell you to go round and see what was
the kind of religious dispensation here?" continued Jack,
with an unmoved face. "Didn't I charge you particularly
to observe if the Catholic Church was such as a professing
Christian and the former organist of the Second Presbyterian
Church of Sacramento could attend? And now I
suppose I've got to find out myself. I'd bet ten to one
you ain't been there at all!"</p>

<p>In sheer embarrassment Pete began to brush his master's
clothes with ostentatious and apologetic diligence, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'se no Papist, Mahs Jack, but if I'd thought"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you suppose I'm going to sit here without my
supper while you abuse the Catholic Church&mdash;the only
church that a gentlemen"&mdash;&mdash;but the frightened Pete
was gone.</p>

<p>The Angelus bell had just rung, and it lacked a full half
hour yet before vespers, when Mr. Hamlin lounged into
the old Mission church. Only a few figures knelt here and
there&mdash;mere vague, black shadows in the gloom. Aided,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
perhaps, more by intuition than the light of the dim candles
on the high altar, he knew that the figure he looked for was
not among them; and seeking the shadow of a column he
calmly waited its approach. It seemed a long time. A
heavy-looking woman, redolent of garlic, came in and
knelt nearly opposite. A yellow vaquero, whom Mr. Hamlin
recalled at once as one he had met on the road hither,&mdash;a
man whose Spanish profanity, incited by unruly cattle,
had excited Jack's amused admiration,&mdash;dropped
on his knees, and with equally characteristic volubility began a
supplication to the Virgin. Then two or three men, whom
Jack recognised as the monte-players of the "Fonda," began,
as it seemed to Jack, to bewail their losses in lachrymose
accents. And then Mr. Hamlin, highly excited, with
a pulse that would have awakened the greatest concern of
his doctor, became nervously and magnetically aware that
some one else was apparently waiting and anxious as himself,
and had turned <i>his</i> head at the entrance of each one
of the congregation. It was a figure Jack had at first overlooked.
Safe in the shadow of the column, he could watch
it without being seen himself. Even in the gloom he could
see the teeth and eyes of the man he had observed that
afternoon&mdash;his old antagonist at Sacramento.</p>

<p>Had it been anywhere else Jack would have indulged
his general and abstract detestation of Victor by instantly
picking a quarrel with him. As it was, he determined
upon following him when he left the church&mdash;of venting
on him any possible chagrin or disappointment he might
then have, as an excitement to mitigate the unsupportable
dreariness of the Mission. The passions are not so exclusive
as moralists imagine, for Mr. Hamlin was beginning
to have his breast filled with wrath against Victor, in
proportion as his doubts of the appearance of the beautiful
stranger grew stronger in his mind, when two figures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
momentarily darkened the church porch, and a rustle of
silk stole upon his ear. A faint odour of spice penetrated
through the incense. Jack looked up, and his heart
stopped beating.</p>

<p>It was she. As she reached the stall nearly opposite,
she put aside her black veil, and disclosed the same calm,
nymph-like face he had seen at the window. It was
doubly beautiful now. Even the strange complexion had
for Jack a bewildering charm. She looked around, hesitated
for a moment, and then knelt between the two
monte-players. With an almost instinctive movement
Jack started forward, as if to warn her of the contaminating
contact. And then he stopped, his own face crimsoned
with shame. For the first time he had doubted the morality
of his profession.</p>

<p>The organ pealed out; the incense swam; the monotonous
voice of the priest rose upon the close, sluggish air,
and Mr. Jack Hamlin dreamed a dream. He had dispossessed
the cold, mechanical organist, and, seating himself
at the instrument, had summoned all the powers of
reed and voice to sing the pæans&mdash;ah me! I fear not of
any abstract Being, but of incarnate flesh and blood. He
heard her pure, young voice lifted beside his; even in that
cold, passionless commingling there was joy unspeakable,
and he knew himself exalted. Yet he was conscious even
in his dream, from his own hurried breathing, and something
that seemed to swell in his throat, that he could not
have sung a note. And then he came back to his senses,
and a close examination of the figure before him. He
looked at the graceful, shining head, the rich lace veil, the
quiet elegance of attire, even to the small satin slipper that
stole from beneath her silken robe&mdash;all united with a refinement
and an air of jealous seclusion, that somehow removed
him to an immeasurable distance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>The anthem ceased, the last notes of the organ died
away, and the lady rose. Half an hour before, Jack would
have gladly stepped forward to have challenged even a
passing glance from the beautiful eyes of the stranger;
now a timidity and distrust new to the man took possession
of him. He even drew back closer in the shadow as she
stepped toward the pillar, which supported on its face a
font of holy water. She had already slipped off her glove,
and now she leaned forward&mdash;so near he could almost feel
her warm breath&mdash;and dipped her long slim fingers into
the water. As she crossed herself with the liquid symbol,
Jack gave a slight start. One or two drops of holy water
thrown from her little fingers had fallen on his face.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER V.</h4>

<h5>VICTOR MAKES A DISCOVERY.</h5>


<p>Happily for Mr. Hamlin, the young girl noticed neither
the effect of her unconscious baptismal act, nor its object,
but moved away slowly to the door. As she did so, Jack
stepped from the shadow of the column, and followed her
with eyes of respectful awe and yearning. She had barely
reached the porch, when she suddenly and swiftly turned
and walked hurriedly back, almost brushing against Mr.
Hamlin. Her beautiful eyes were startled and embarrassed,
her scarlet lips parted and paling rapidly, her whole figure
and manner agitated and discomposed. Without noticing
him she turned toward the column, and under the pretext
of using the holy water, took hold of the font, and leaned
against it, as if for support, with her face averted from the
light. Jack could see her hands tighten nervously on the
stone, and fancied that her whole figure trembled as she
stood there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>He hesitated for a moment, and then moved to her side;
not audaciously and confident, as was his wont with women,
but with a boyish colour in his face, and a timid, half-embarrassed
manner.</p>

<p>"Can I do anything for you, Miss?" he said, falteringly.
"You don't seem to be well. I mean you look tired. Shan't
I bring you a chair? It's the heat of this hole&mdash;I mean it's
so warm here. Shan't I go for a glass of water, a carriage?"</p>

<p>Here she suddenly lifted her eyes to his, and his voice
and presence of mind utterly abandoned him.</p>

<p>"It's nothing," she said, with a dignified calm, as sudden
and as alarming to Jack as her previous agitation&mdash;"nothing,"
she added, fixing her clear eyes on his, with a
look so frank, so open, and withal, as it seemed to Jack, so
cold and indifferent, that his own usually bold glance fell
beneath it, "nothing but the heat and closeness; I am
better now."</p>

<p>"Shall I"&mdash;&mdash;began Jack, awkwardly.</p>

<p>"I want nothing, thank you."</p>

<p>Seeming to think that her conduct required some explanation,
she added, hastily&mdash;</p>

<p>"There was a crowd at the door as I was going out, and
in the press I felt giddy. I thought some one&mdash;some
man&mdash;pushed me rudely. I daresay I was mistaken."</p>

<p>She glanced at the porch against which a man was still
leaning.</p>

<p>The suggestion of her look and speech&mdash;if it were a suggestion&mdash;was
caught instantly by Jack. Without waiting
for her to finish the sentence, he strode to the door. To
his wrathful surprise the lounger was Victor. Mr. Hamlin
did not stop for explanatory speech. With a single expressive
word, and a single dexterous movement of his arm
and foot, he tumbled the astonished Victor down the steps
at one side, and then turned toward his late companion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
But she had been equally prompt. With a celerity quite
inconsistent with her previous faintness, she seized the
moment that Victor disappeared to dart by him and gain
her carriage, which stood in waiting at the porch. But as
it swiftly drove away, Mr. Hamlin caught one grateful glance
from those wonderful eyes, one smile from those perfect
lips, and was happy. What matters that he had an explanation&mdash;possibly
a quarrel on his hands? Ah me! I fear
this added zest to the rascal's satisfaction.</p>

<p>A hand was laid on his shoulder. He turned and saw the
face of the furious Victor, with every tooth at a white heat,
and panting with passion. Mr. Hamlin smiled pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Why, I want to know!" he ejaculated, with an affectation
of rustic simplicity, "if it ain't you, Johnny. Why,
darn my skin! And this is your house? You and St.
Anthony in partnership, eh? Well, that gets me! And
here I tumbled you off your own stoop, didn't I? I might
have known it was you by the way you stood there. Mightn't
I, Johnny?"</p>

<p>"My name is not Johnny&mdash;<i>Carámba!</i>" gasped Victor,
almost beside himself with impatient fury.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's that, is it? Any relation to the <i>Carámbas</i> of
Dutch Flat? It ain't a pretty name. I like Johnny better.
And I wouldn't make a row here now. Not to-day, Johnny;
it's Sunday. I'd go home. I'd go quietly home, and I'd
beat some woman or child to keep myself in training. But
I'd go home first. I wouldn't draw that knife, neither, for
it might cut your fingers, and frighten the folks around
town. I'd go home quietly, like a good nice little man.
And in the morning I'd come round to the hotel on the
next square, and I'd ask for Mr. Hamlin, Mr. Jack Hamlin,
Room No. 29; and I'd go right up to his room, and I'd
have such a time with him&mdash;such a high old time; I'd
just make that hotel swim with blood."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>Two or three of the monte players had gathered around
Victor, and seemed inclined to take the part of their
countryman. Victor was not slow to improve this moment
of adhesion and support.</p>

<p>"Is it dogs that we are, my compatriots?" he said to
them bitterly; "and he&mdash;this one&mdash;a man infamous!"</p>

<p>Mr. Hamlin, who had a quick ear for abusive and interjaculatory
Spanish, overheard him. There was a swift
chorus of "<i>Carámba!</i>" from the allies, albeit wholesomely
restrained by something in Mr. Hamlin's eye which was
visible, and probably a suspicion of something in Mr.
Hamlin's pocket which was not visible. But the remaining
portion of Mr. Hamlin was ironically gracious.</p>

<p>"Friends of yours, I suppose?" he inquired, affably.
"'<i>Carámbas</i>' all of them, too! Perhaps they'll call with
you? Maybe they haven't time and are in a hurry now?
If my room isn't large enough, and they can't wait, there's
a handy lot o' ground beyond on the next square&mdash;<i>Plaza
del Toros</i>, eh? What did you say? I'm a little deaf in
this ear."</p>

<p>Under the pretence of hearing more distinctly, Jack
Hamlin approached the nearest man, who, I grieve to
say, instantly and somewhat undignifiedly retreated. Mr.
Hamlin laughed. But already a crowd of loungers had
gathered, and he felt it was time to end this badinage,
grateful as it was to his sense of humour. So he lifted his
hat gravely to Victor and his friends, replaced it perhaps
aggressively tilted a trifle over his straight nose, and
lounged slowly back to his hotel, leaving his late adversaries
in secure but unsatisfactory and dishonourable possession
of the field. Once in his own quarters, he roused
the sleeping Pete, and insisted upon opening a religious
discussion, in which, to Pete's great horror, he warmly
espoused the Catholic Church, averring, with several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
strong expletives, that it was the only religion fit for a
white man, and ending somewhat irreverently by inquiring
into the condition of the pistols.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Victor had also taken leave of his friends.</p>

<p>"He has fled&mdash;this most infamous!" he said; "he
dared not remain and face us! Thou didst observe his
fear, Tiburcio? It was thy great heart that did it!"</p>

<p>"Rather he recognised thee, my Victor, and his heart
was that of the coyote."</p>

<p>"It was the Mexican nation, ever responsive to the
appeal of manhood and liberty, that made his liver as
blanched as that of the chicken," returned the gentleman
who had retreated from Jack. "Let us then celebrate
this triumph with a little glass."</p>

<p>And Victor, who was anxious to get away from his
friends, and saw in the prospective <i>aguardiente</i> a chance
for escape, generously led the way to the first wine-shop.</p>

<p>It chanced to be the principal one of the town. It had
the generic quality&mdash;that is, was dirty, dingy, ill-smelling,
and yellow with cigarette smoke. Its walls were adorned
by various prints&mdash;one or two French in origin, excellent
in art, and defective in moral sentiment, and several of
Spanish origin, infamous in art, and admirable in religious
feeling. It had a portrait of Santa Anna, and another of
the latest successful revolutionary general. It had an
allegorical picture representing the Genius of Liberty
descending with all the celestial machinery upon the
Mexican Confederacy. Moved apparently by the same
taste for poetry and personification, the proprietor had
added to his artistic collection a highly coloured American
handbill representing the Angel of Healing presenting a
stricken family with a bottle of somebody's Panacea. At
the farther extremity of the low room a dozen players sat
at a green-baize table absorbed in monte. Beyond them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
leaning against the wall, a harp-player twanged the strings
of his instrument, in a lugubrious air, with that singular
stickiness of touch and reluctancy of finger peculiar to
itinerant performers on that instrument. The card-players
were profoundly indifferent to both music and performer.</p>

<p>The face of one of the players attracted Victor's attention.
It was that of the odd English translator&mdash;the
irascible stranger upon whom he had intruded that night
of his memorable visit to Don José. Victor had no difficulty
in recognising him, although his slovenly and
negligent working-dress had been changed to his holiday
antique black suit. He did not lift his eyes from the
game until he had lost the few silver coins placed in a pile
before him, when he rose grimly, and nodding brusquely
to the other players, without speaking left the room.</p>

<p>"He has lost five half-dollars&mdash;his regular limit&mdash;no
more, no less," said Victor to his friend. "He will not
play again to-night!"</p>

<p>"You know of him?" asked Vincente, in admiration of
his companion's superior knowledge.</p>

<p>"Si!" said Victor. "He is a jackal, a dog of the
Americanos," he added, vaguely intending to revenge himself
on the stranger's former brusqueness by this depreciation.
"He affects to know our history&mdash;our language.
Is it a question of the fine meaning of a word&mdash;the shade
of a technical expression?&mdash;it is him they ask, not us! It
is thus they treat us, these heretics! <i>Carámba!</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Carámba!</i>" echoed Vincente, with a vague patriotism
superinduced by <i>aguardiente</i>. But Victor had calculated to
unloose Vincente's tongue for his private service.</p>

<p>"It is the world, my friend," he said, sententiously.
"These Americanos&mdash;come they here often?"</p>

<p>"You know the great American advocate&mdash;our friend&mdash;Don
Arturo Poinsett?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Victor, impatiently. "Comes he?"</p>

<p>"Eh! does he not?" laughed Vincente. "Always. Ever.
Eternally. He has a client&mdash;a widow, young, handsome,
rich, eh?&mdash;one of his own race."</p>

<p>"Ah! you are wise, Vincente!"</p>

<p>Vincente laughed a weak spirituous laugh.</p>

<p>"Ah! it is a transparent fact. Truly&mdash;of a verity.
Believe me!"</p>

<p>"And this fair client&mdash;who is she?"</p>

<p>"Donna Maria Sepulvida!" said Vincente, in a drunken
whisper.</p>

<p>"How is this? You said she was of his own race."</p>

<p>"Truly, I did. She is <i>Americana</i>. But it is years ago.
She was very young. When the Americans first came, she
was of the first. She taught the child of the widower Don
José Sepulvida, herself almost a child; you understand? It
was the old story. She was pretty, and poor, and young; the
Don grizzled, and old, and rich. It was fire and tow. Eh?
Ha! Ha! The Don meant to be kind, you understand,
and made a rich wife of the little <i>Americana</i>. He was
kinder than he meant, and in two years, <i>Carámba!</i> made a
richer widow of the Donna."</p>

<p>If Vincente had not been quite thrown by his potations,
he would have seen an undue eagerness in Victor's mouth
and eyes.</p>

<p>"And she is pretty&mdash;tall and slender like the Americans,
eh?&mdash;large eyes, a sweet mouth?"</p>

<p>"An angel. Ravishing!"</p>

<p>"And Don Arturo&mdash;from legal adviser turns a lover!"</p>

<p>"It is said," responded Vincente, with drunken cunning
and exceeding archness; "but thou and I, Victor, know
better. Love comes not with a brief! Eh? Look, it is
an old flame, believe me. It is said it is not two months
that he first came here, and she fell in love with him at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
the first glance. <i>Absurdo! Disparátado!</i> Hear me,
Victor; it was an old flame; an old quarrel made up.
Thou and I have heard the romance before. Two lovers
not rich, eh? Good! Separation; despair. The Señorita
marries the rich man, eh?"</p>

<p>Victor was too completely carried away by the suggestion
of his friend's speech, to conceal his satisfaction. Here was
the secret at last. Here was not only a clue, but absolutely
the missing Grace Conroy herself. In this young <i>Americana</i>&mdash;this&mdash;widow&mdash;this
client of her former lover, Philip
Ashley, he held the secret of three lives. In his joy he
slapped Vincente on the back, and swore roundly that he
was the wisest of men.</p>

<p>"I should have seen her&mdash;the heroine of this romance&mdash;my
friend. Possibly, she was at mass?"</p>

<p>"Possibly not. She is Catholic, but Don Arturo is not.
She does not often attend when he is here."</p>

<p>"As to-day?"</p>

<p>"As to-day."</p>

<p>"You are wrong, friend Vincente," said Victor, a little
impatiently. "I was there; I saw her."</p>

<p>Vincente shrugged his shoulders and shook his head with
drunken gravity.</p>

<p>"It is impossible, Señor Victor, believe me."</p>

<p>"I tell you I saw her," said Victor, excitedly. "<i>Borrachon!</i>
She was there! By the pillar. As she went out
she partook of <i>agua bendita</i>. I saw her; large eyes, an
oval face, a black dress and mantle."</p>

<p>Vincente, who, happily for Victor, had not heard the
epithet of his friend, shook his head and laughed a conceited
drunken laugh.</p>

<p>"Tell me not this, friend Victor. It was not her thou didst
see. Believe me, I am wise. It was the Donna Dolores
who partook of <i>agua bendita</i>, and alone. For there is none,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
thou knowest, that has a right to offer it to her. Look you,
foolish Victor, she has large eyes, a small mouth, an oval
face. And dark&mdash;ah, she is dark!"</p>

<p>"'In the dark all are as the devil,'" quoted Victor, impatiently,
"how should I know? Who then <i>is</i> she?" he
demanded almost fiercely, as if struggling with a rising
fear. "Who is this Donna Dolores?"</p>

<p>"Thou art a stranger, friend Victor. Hark ye. It is the
half-breed daughter of the old commander of San Ysabel.
Yet, such is the foolishness of old men, she is his heiress!
She is rich, and lately she has come into possession of a
great grant, very valuable. Thou dost understand, friend
Victor? Well, why dost thou stare? She is a recluse.
Marriage is not for her; love, love! the tender, the subduing,
the delicious, is not for her. She is of the Church, my
Victor. And to think that thou didst mistake this ascetic,
this nun, this little brown novice, this Donna Dolores
Salvatierra for the little American coquette. Ha! Ha! It
is worth the fee of another bottle? Eh? Victor, my friend!
Thou dost not listen. Eh? Thou wouldst fly, traitor.
Eh? what's that thou sayst? Bobo! Dupe thyself!"</p>

<p>For Victor stood before him, dumb, but for that single
epithet. Was he not a dupe? Had he not been cheated
again, and this time by a blunder in his own malice? If
he had really, as he believed, identified Grace Conroy in
this dark-faced devotee whose name he now learned for
the first time, by what diabolical mischance had he deliberately
put her in possession of the forged grant, and so
blindly restored her the missing property? Could Don
Pedro have been treacherous? Could he have known,
could they all&mdash;Arthur Poinsett, Dumphy, and Julie Devarges&mdash;have
known this fact of which he alone was
ignorant? Were they not laughing at him now? The
thought was madness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>With a vague impression of being shaken rudely off by
a passionate hand, and a drunken vision of a ghastly and
passionate face before him uttering words of impotent rage
and baffled despair, Vincente, the wise and valiant, came
slowly and amazedly to himself, lying over the table. But
his late companion was gone.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER VI.</h4>

<h5>AN EXPERT.</h5>


<p>A cold, grey fog had that night stolen noiselessly in from
the sea, and, after possessing the town, had apparently
intruded itself in the long, low plain before the <i>hacienda</i>
of the Rancho of the Holy Trinity, where it sullenly lingered
even after the morning sun had driven in its eastern outposts.
Viewed from the Mission towers, it broke a cold
grey sea against the corral of the <i>hacienda</i>, and half hid the
white walls of the <i>hacienda</i> itself. It was characteristic of
the Rancho that, under such conditions, at certain times
it seemed to vanish entirely from the sight, or rather to
lose and melt itself into the outlines of the low foot-hills,
and Mr. Perkins, the English translator, driving a buggy
that morning in that direction, was forced once or twice to
stop and take his bearings anew, until the grey sea fell,
and the <i>hacienda</i> again heaved slowly into view.</p>

<p>Although Mr. Perkins' transformations were well known
to his intimate associates, it might have been difficult for
any stranger to have recognised the slovenly drudge of
Pacific Street, in the antique dandy who drove the buggy.
Mr. Perkins' hair was brushed, curled, and darkened by
dye. A high stock of a remote fashion encompassed his
neck, above which his face, whitened by cosmetics to conceal
his high complexion, rested stiffly and expressionless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
as a mask. A light blue coat buttoned tightly over his
breast, and a pair of close-fitting trousers strapped over his
japanned leather boots, completed his remarkable <i>ensemble</i>.
It was a figure well known on Montgomery Street after
three o'clock&mdash;seldom connected with the frousy visitor of
the Pacific Street den, and totally unrecognisable on the
plains of San Antonio.</p>

<p>It was evident, however, that this figure, eccentric as it
was, was expected at the <i>hacienda</i>, and recognised as having
an importance beyond its antique social distinction. For,
when Mr. Perkins drew up in the courtyard, the grave
<i>major domo</i> at once ushered him into the formal, low-studded
drawing-room already described in these pages,
and in another instant the Donna Dolores Salvatierra stood
before him.</p>

<p>With a refined woman's delicacy of perception, Donna
Dolores instantly detected under this bizarre exterior
something that atoned for it, which she indicated by the
depth of the half-formal curtsey she made it. Mr. Perkins
met the salutation with a bow equally formal and respectful.
He was evidently agreeably surprised at his reception,
and impressed with her manner. But like most men of
ill-assured social position, he was a trifle suspicious and
on the defensive. With a graceful gesture of her fan, the
Donna pointed to a chair, but her guest remained standing.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> am a stranger to you, Señor, but <i>you</i> are none to
me," she said, with a gracious smile. "Before I ventured
upon the boldness of seeking this interview, your intelligence,
your experience, your honourable report was already
made known to me by your friends. Let me call myself
one of these&mdash;even before I break the business for which
I have summoned you."</p>

<p>The absurd figure bowed again, but even through the
pitiable chalk and cosmetics of its complexion, an embarrassed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
colour showed itself. Donna Dolores noticed it,
but delicately turned toward an old-fashioned secretary,
and opened it, to give her visitor time to recover himself.
She drew from a little drawer a folded, legal-looking
document, and then placing two chairs beside the secretary,
seated herself in one. Thus practically reminded of
his duty, Mr. Perkins could no longer decline the proffered
seat.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Donna Dolores, "that my business,
although familiar to you generally&mdash;although you are
habitually consulted upon just such questions&mdash;may seem
strange to you, when you frankly learn my motives. Here
is a grant purporting to have been made to my&mdash;father&mdash;the
late Don José Salvatierra. Examine it carefully, and
answer me a single question to the best of your judgment."
She hesitated, and then added&mdash;"Let me say, before you
answer yes or no, that to me there are no pecuniary
interests involved&mdash;nothing that should make you hesitate
to express an opinion which you might be called upon
legally to prove. <i>That</i> you will never be required to give.
Your answer will be accepted by me in confidence; will
not, as far as the world is concerned, alter the money value
of this document&mdash;will leave you free hereafter to express
a different opinion, or even to reverse your judgment
publicly if the occasion requires it. You seem astounded,
Señor Perkins. But I am a rich woman. I have no need
to ask your judgment to increase my wealth."</p>

<p>"Your question is"&mdash;&mdash;said Mr. Perkins, speaking for
the first time without embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Is that document a forgery?"</p>

<p>He took it out of her hand, opened it with a kind of
professional carelessness, barely glanced at the signature
and seals, and returned it.</p>

<p>"The signatures are genuine," he said, with business-like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
brevity; then he added, as if in explanation of that
brevity, "I have seen it before."</p>

<p>Donna Dolores moved her chair with the least show of
uneasiness. The movement attracted Mr. Perkins' attention.
It was something novel. Here was a woman who
appeared actually annoyed that her claim to a valuable
property was valid. He fixed his eyes upon her curiously.</p>

<p>"Then you think it is a genuine grant?" she said, with
a slight sigh.</p>

<p>"As genuine as any that receive a patent at Washington,"
he replied, promptly.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Donna Dolores, simply. The feminine
interjection appeared to put a construction upon Señor
Perkins' reply that both annoyed and challenged him.
He assumed the defensive.</p>

<p>"Have you any reason to doubt the genuineness of this
particular document?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It was only recently discovered among Don
José's papers, and there is another in existence."</p>

<p>Señor Perkins again reached out his hand, took the
paper, examined it attentively, held it to the light and
then laid it down. "It is all right," he said. "Where is
the other?"</p>

<p>"I have it not," said Donna Dolores.</p>

<p>Señor Perkins shrugged his shoulders respectfully as to
Donna Dolores, but scornfully of an unbusiness-like sex.
"How did you expect me to institute a comparison?"</p>

<p>"There is no comparison necessary if that document is
genuine," said the Donna, quickly.</p>

<p>Señor Perkins was embarrassed for a moment. "I
mean there might be some mistake. Under what circumstances
is it held&mdash;who holds it? To whom was it
given?"</p>

<p>"That is a part of my story. It was given five years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
ago to a Dr. Devarges&mdash;I beg your pardon, did you
speak?"</p>

<p>Señor Perkins had not spoken, but was staring with
grim intensity at Donna Dolores. "You&mdash;said&mdash;Dr.
Devarges," he repeated, slowly.</p>

<p>"Yes. Did you know him?" It was Donna Dolores'
turn to be embarrassed. She bit her lip and slightly contracted
her eyebrows. For a moment they both stood on
the defensive.</p>

<p>"I have heard the name before," Mr. Perkins said at
last, with a forced laugh.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is the name of a distinguished <i>savant</i>," said
Donna Dolores, composedly. "Well&mdash;<i>he</i> is dead. But
he gave this grant to a young girl named&mdash;named"&mdash;Dolores
paused as if to recall the name&mdash;"named Grace
Conroy."</p>

<p>She stopped and raised her eyes quickly to her companion,
but his face was unmoved, and his momentary
excitement seemed to have passed. He nodded his head
for her to proceed.</p>

<p>"Named Grace Conroy," repeated Donna Dolores, more
rapidly, and with freer breath. "After the lapse of five
years a woman&mdash;an impostor&mdash;appears to claim the grant
under the name of Grace Conroy. But perhaps finding
difficulty in carrying out her infamous scheme, by some
wicked, wicked art, she gains the affections of the brother
of this Grace, and marries him as the next surviving heir."
And Donna Dolores paused, a little out of breath, with a
glow under her burnished cheek and a slight metallic
quality in her voice. It was perhaps no more than the
natural indignation of a quickly sympathising nature, but
Mr. Perkins did not seem to notice it. In fact, within
the last few seconds his whole manner had become absent
and preoccupied; the stare which he had fixed a moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
before on Donna Dolores was now turned to the wall, and
his old face, under its juvenile mask, looked still older.</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly," he said at last, recalling himself
with an effort. "But all this only goes to prove that the
grant may be as fraudulent as the owner. Then, you have
nothing really to make you suspicious of your own claim
but the fact of its recent discovery? Well, that I don't
think need trouble you. Remember your grant was given
when lands were not valuable, and your late father might
have overlooked it as unimportant." He rose with a
slight suggestion in his manner that the interview had
closed. He appeared anxious to withdraw, and not entirely
free from the same painful pre-absorption that he
had lately shown. With a slight shade of disappointment
in her face Donna Dolores also rose.</p>

<p>In another moment he would have been gone, and the
lives of these two people thus brought into natural yet
mysterious contact have flowed on unchanged in each
monotonous current. But as he reached the door he
turned to ask a trivial question. On that question trembled
the future of both.</p>

<p>"This real Grace Conroy then I suppose has disappeared.
And this&mdash;Doctor&mdash;Devarges"&mdash;he hesitated
at the name as something equally fictitious&mdash;"you say is
dead. How then did this impostor gain the knowledge
necessary to set up the claim? Who is <i>she</i>?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she is&mdash;that is&mdash;she married Gabriel Conroy under
the name of the widow of Dr. Devarges. Pardon me! I
did not hear what you said. Holy Virgin! What is the
matter? You are ill. Let me call Sanchez! Sit here!"</p>

<p>He dropped into a chair, but only for an instant. As
she turned to call assistance he rose and caught her by the
arm.</p>

<p>"I am better," he said. "It is nothing&mdash;I am often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
taken in this way. Don't look at me. Don't call anybody
except to get me a glass of water&mdash;there, that will
do."</p>

<p>He took the glass she brought him, and instead of
drinking it threw back his head and poured it slowly over
his forehead and face as he leaned backward in the chair.
Then he drew out a large silk handkerchief and wiped his
face and hair until they were dry. Then he sat up and
faced her. The chalk and paint was off his face, his high
stock had become unbuckled, he had unbuttoned his coat
and it hung loosely over his gaunt figure; his hair, although
still dripping, seemed to have become suddenly
bristling and bushy over his red face. But he was perfectly
self-possessed, and his voice had completely lost its previous
embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Rush of blood to the head," he said, quietly; "felt it
coming on all the morning. Gone now. Nothing like
cold water and sitting posture. Hope I didn't spoil your
carpet. And now to come back to your business." He
drew up his chair, without the least trace of his former
diffidence, beside Donna Dolores, "Let's take another
look at your grant." He took it up, drew a small magnifying
glass from his pocket and examined the signature.
"Yes, yes! signature all right. Seal of the Custom House.
Paper all regular." He rustled it in his fingers, "You're
all right&mdash;the swindle is with Madame Devarges. There's
the forgery&mdash;there's this spurious grant."</p>

<p>"I think not," said Donna Dolores, quietly.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Suppose the grant is exactly like this in everything,
paper, signature, seal and all."</p>

<p>"That proves nothing," said Mr. Perkins, quickly.
"Look you. When this grant was drawn&mdash;in the early
days&mdash;there were numbers of these grants lying in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
Custom House like waste paper, drawn and signed by the
Governor, in blank, only wanting filling in by a clerk to
make them a valid document. She!&mdash;this impostor&mdash;this
Madame Devarges, has had access to these blanks, as
many have since the American Conquest, and that grant
is the result. But she is not wise, no! I know the
handwriting of the several copyists and clerks&mdash;I was
one myself. Put me on the stand, Donna Dolores&mdash;put
me on the stand, and I'll confront her as I have the
others."</p>

<p>"You forget," said Donna Dolores, coldly, "that I have
no desire to legally test this document. And if Spanish
grants are so easily made, why might not this one of mine
be a fabrication? You say you know the handwriting of
the copyists&mdash;look at this."</p>

<p>Mr. Perkins seized the grant impatiently, and ran his eye
quickly over the interlineations between the printed portions.
"Strange!" he muttered. "This is not my own nor
Sanchez; nor Ruiz; it is a new hand. Ah! what have we
here&mdash;a correction in the date&mdash;in still another hand?
And this&mdash;surely I have seen something like it in the office.
But where?" He stopped, ran his fingers through his hair,
but after an effort at recollection abandoned the attempt.
"But why?" he said, abruptly, "why should this be
forged?"</p>

<p>"Suppose that the other were genuine, and suppose that
this woman got possession of it in some wicked way.
Suppose that some one, knowing of this, endeavoured by
this clever forgery to put difficulties in her way without
exposing her."</p>

<p>"But who would do that?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps the brother&mdash;her husband! Perhaps some
one," continued Donna Dolores, embarrassedly, with the
colour struggling through her copper cheek, "some&mdash;one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
&mdash;who&mdash;did&mdash;not&mdash;believe that the real Grace Conroy was
dead or missing!"</p>

<p>"Suppose the devil!&mdash;I beg your pardon. But people
don't forge documents in the interests of humanity and
justice. And why should it be given to <i>you</i>?"</p>

<p>"I am known to be a rich woman," said Donna Dolores.
"I believe," she added, dropping her eyes with a certain
proud diffidence that troubled even the preoccupied man
before her, "I&mdash;believe&mdash;that is I am told&mdash;that I have a
reputation for being liberal, and&mdash;and just."</p>

<p>Mr. Perkins looked it her for a moment with undisguised
admiration. "But suppose," he said, with a bitterness
that seemed to grow out of that very contemplation,
"suppose this woman, this adventuress, this impostor,
were a creature that made any such theory impossible.
Suppose she were one who could poison the very life and
soul of any man&mdash;to say nothing of the man who was legally
bound to her; suppose she were a devil who could deceive
the mind and heart, who could make the very man she was
betraying most believe her guiltless and sinned against;
suppose she were capable of not even the weakness of
passion; but that all her acts were shrewd, selfish, pre-calculated
even to a smile or a tear&mdash;do you think such
a woman&mdash;whom, thank God! such as <i>you</i> cannot even
imagine&mdash;do you suppose such a woman would not have
guarded against even this? No! no!"</p>

<p>"Unless," said Donna Dolores, leaning against the
secretary with the glow gone from her dark face and a
strange expression trembling over her mouth, "unless it
were the revenge of some rival."</p>

<p>Her companion started. "Good! It is so," he muttered
to himself. "<i>I</i> would have done it. I could have done
it! You are right, Donna Dolores." He walked to the
window and then came hurriedly back, buttoning his coat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
as he did so, and rebuckling his stock. "Some one is
coming! Leave this matter with me. I will satisfy you
and myself concerning this affair. Will you trust this paper
with me?" Donna Dolores without a word placed it in
his hand. "Thank you," he said, with a slight return of
his former embarrassment, that seemed to belong to his
ridiculous stock and his buttoned coat rather than any
physical or moral quality. "Don't believe me entirely
disinterested either," he added, with a strange smile.
"<i>Adios.</i>"</p>

<p>She would have asked another question, but at that
instant the clatter of hoofs and sound of voices arose from
the courtyard, and with a hurried bow he was gone. The
door opened again almost instantly to the bright laughing
face and coquettish figure of Mrs. Sepulvida.</p>

<p>"Well!" said that little lady, as soon as she recovered
her breath. "For a religiously inclined young person and
a notorious recluse, I must say you certainly have more
masculine company than falls to the lot of the worldly.
Here I ran across a couple of fellows hanging around the
<i>casa</i> as I drove up, and come in only to find you closeted
with an old exquisite. Who was it&mdash;another lawyer, dear?
I declare, it's too bad. <i>I</i> have only one!"</p>

<p>"And that one is enough, eh?" smiled Donna Dolores,
somewhat gravely, as she playfully tapped Mrs. Sepulvida's
fair cheek with her fan.</p>

<p>"Oh yes!" she blushed a little coquettishly&mdash;"of
course! And here I rode over, post haste, to tell you the
news. But first, tell me who is that wicked, dashing-looking
fellow outside the courtyard? It can't be the lawyer's
clerk."</p>

<p>"I don't know who you mean; but it is, I suppose,"
said Donna Dolores, a little wearily. "But tell me the
news. I am all attention."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>But Mrs. Sepulvida ran to the deep embrasured window
and peeped out. "It isn't the lawyer, for he is driving
away in his buggy, as if he were hurrying to get out of the
fog, and my gentleman still remains. Dolores!" said Mrs.
Sepulvida, suddenly facing her friend with an expression of
mock gravity and humour, "this won't do! Who is that
cavalier?"</p>

<p>With a terrible feeling that she was about to meet the
keen eyes of Victor, Donna Dolores drew near the window
from the side where she could look out without being herself
seen. Her first glance at the figure of the stranger
satisfied her that her fears were unfounded; it was not
Victor. Reassured, she drew the curtain more boldly.
At that instant the mysterious horseman wheeled, and she
met full in her own the black eyes of Mr. Jack Hamlin.
Donna Dolores instantly dropped the curtain and turned
to her friend.</p>

<p>"I don't know!"</p>

<p>"Truly, Dolores?"</p>

<p>"Truly, Maria."</p>

<p>"Well, I believe you. I suppose then it must be
<i>me</i>!"</p>

<p>Donna Dolores smiled, and playfully patted Mrs. Sepulvida's
joyous face.</p>

<p>"Well, then?" she said invitingly.</p>

<p>"Well, then," responded Mrs. Sepulvida, half in embarrassment
and half in satisfaction.</p>

<p>"The news!" said Donna Dolores.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;well," said Mrs. Sepulvida, with mock deliberation,
"it has come at last!"</p>

<p>"It has?" said Donna Dolores, looking gravely at her
friend.</p>

<p>"Yes. He has been there again to-day."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>"And he asked you?" said Donna Dolores, opening her
fan and turning her face toward the window.</p>

<p>"He asked me."</p>

<p>"And you said"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mrs. Sepulvida tripped gaily toward the window and
looked out.</p>

<p>"I said"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"NO!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

<h5>IN WHICH GABRIEL RECOGNISES THE PROPRIETIES.</h5>


<p>After the visit of Mr. Peter Dumphy, One Horse Gulch
was not surprised at the news of any stroke of good fortune.
It was enough that he, the great capitalist, the successful
speculator, had been there! The information that a company
had been formed to develop a rich silver mine recently
discovered on Conroy's Hill was received as a matter of
course. Already the theories of the discovery were perfectly
well established. That it was simply a grand speculative
<i>coup</i> of Dumphy's&mdash;that upon a boldly conceived plan
this man intended to build up the town of One Horse Gulch&mdash;that
he had invented "the lead" and backed it by an
ostentatious display of capital in mills and smelting works
solely for a speculative purpose; that five years before he
had selected Gabriel Conroy as a simple-minded tool for
this design; that Gabriel's Two and One Half Millions was
merely an exaggerated form of expressing the exact wages&mdash;One
Thousand dollars a year, which was all Dumphy had
paid him for the use of his name, and that it was the duty
of every man to endeavour to realise quickly on the advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
of property before this enormous bubble burst&mdash;this was the
theory of one-half the people of One Horse Gulch. On the
other hand, there was a large party who knew exactly the
reverse. That the whole thing was purely accidental; that
Mr. Peter Dumphy being called by other business to One
Horse Gulch, while walking with Gabriel Conroy one day
had picked up a singular piece of rock on Gabriel's claim,
and had said, "This looks like silver;" that Gabriel Conroy
had laughed at the suggestion, whereat Mr. Peter Dumphy,
who never laughed, had turned about curtly and demanded
in his usual sharp business way, "Will you take Seventeen
Millions for all your right and title to this claim?" That
Gabriel&mdash;"you know what a blank fool Gabe is!"&mdash;had
assented, "and this way, sir, actually disposed of a property
worth, on the lowest calculation, One Hundred and Fifty
Millions." This was the generally accepted theory of the
other and more imaginative portion of One Horse Gulch.</p>

<p>Howbeit within the next few weeks following the advent
of Mr. Dumphy, the very soil seemed to have quickened
through that sunshine, and all over the settlement pieces of
plank and scantling&mdash;thin blades of new dwellings&mdash;started
up under that beneficent presence. On the bleak hill sides
the more extensive foundations of the Conroy Smelting
Works were laid. The modest boarding-house and restaurant
of Mrs. Markle was found inadequate to the wants and
inconsistent with the greatness of One Horse Gulch, and a
new hotel was erected. But here I am anticipating another
evidence of progress&mdash;namely, the daily newspaper, in
which these events were reported with a combination of
ease and elegance one may envy yet never attain. Said the
<i>Times</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The Grand Conroy House, now being inaugurated, will be managed
by Mrs. Susan Markle, whose talents as a <i>chef de cuisine</i> are as
well known to One Horse Gulch as her rare social graces and magnificent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>personal charms. She will be aided by her former accomplished
assistant, Miss Sarah Clark. As hash-slinger, Sal can walk over
anything of her weight in Plumas."</p></blockquote>

<p>With these and other evidences of an improvement in
public taste, the old baleful title of "One Horse Gulch"
was deemed incongruous. It was proposed to change that
name to "Silveropolis," there being, in the figurative language
of the Gulch, "more than one horse could draw."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the nominal and responsible position of Superintendent
of the new works was filled by Gabriel, although
the actual business and executive duty was performed by a
sharp, snappy young fellow of about half Gabriel's size,
supplied by the Company. This was in accordance with
the wishes of Gabriel, who could not bear idleness; and the
Company, although distrusting his administrative ability,
wisely recognised his great power over the workmen through
the popularity of his easy democratic manners, and his
disposition always to lend his valuable physical assistance
in cases of emergency. Gabriel had become a great
favourite with the men ever since they found that prosperity
had not altered his simple nature. It was pleasant
to them to be able to point out to a stranger this plain,
unostentatious, powerful giant, working like themselves, and
with themselves, with the added information that he owned
half the mine, and was worth Seventeen Millions! Always
a shy and rather lonely man, his wealth seemed to have
driven him, by its very oppressiveness, to the society of his
humble fellows for relief. A certain deprecatoriness of
manner whenever his riches were alluded to, strengthened
the belief of some in that theory that he was merely the
creature of Dumphy's speculation.</p>

<p>Although Gabriel was always assigned a small and
insignificant part in the present prosperity of One Horse
Gulch, it was somewhat characteristic of the peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
wrongheadedness of this community that no one ever
suspected his wife of any complicity in it. It had been
long since settled that her superiority to her husband was
chiefly the feminine charm of social grace and physical
attraction. That, warmed by the sunshine of affluence,
this butterfly would wantonly flit from flower to flower, and
eventually quit her husband and One Horse Gulch for
some more genial clime, was never doubted. "She'll
make them millions fly ef she hez to fly with it," was the
tenor of local criticism. A pity, not unmixed with contempt,
was felt for Gabriel's apparent indifference to this
prophetic outlook; his absolute insensibility to his wife's
ambiguous reputation was looked upon as the hopelessness
of a thoroughly deceived man. Even Mrs. Markle, whose
attempts to mollify Olly had been received coldly by that
young woman&mdash;even she was a convert to the theory of
the complete domination of the Conroy household by this
alien and stranger.</p>

<p>But despite this baleful prophecy, Mrs. Conroy did not
fly nor show any inclination to leave her husband. A new
house was built, with that rapidity of production that
belonged to the climate, among the pines of Conroy's Hill,
which on the hottest summer day still exuded the fresh
sap of its green timbers and exhaled a woodland spicery.
Here the good taste of Mrs. Conroy flowered in chintz,
and was always fresh and feminine in white muslin curtains
and pretty carpets, and here the fraternal love of Gabriel
brought a grand piano for the use of Olly, and a teacher.
Hither also came the best citizens of the county&mdash;even the
notabilities of the State, feeling that Mr. Dumphy had, to
a certain extent, made One Horse Gulch respectable, soon
found out also that Mrs. Conroy was attractive; the Hon.
Blank had dined there on the occasion of his last visit to
his constituents of the Gulch; the Hon. Judge Beeswinger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
had told in her parlour several of his most effective stories.
Colonel Starbottle's manly breast had dilated over her
dish-covers, and he had carried away with him not only a
vivid appreciation of her charms capable of future eloquent
expression, but an equally vivid idea of his own fascinations,
equally incapable of concealment. Gabriel himself
rarely occupied the house except for the exigencies of food
and nightly shelter. If decoyed there at other times by
specious invitations of Olly, he compromised by sitting on
the back porch in his shirt sleeves, alleging as a reason his
fear of the contaminating influence of his short black pipe.</p>

<p>"Don't ye mind <i>me</i>, July," he would say, when his
spouse with anxious face and deprecatory manner would
waive her native fastidiousness and aver that "she liked
it." "Don't ye mind me, I admire to sit out yer. I'm a
heap more comfortable outer doors, and allus waz. I
reckon the smell might get into them curtings, and then&mdash;and
then," added Gabriel, quietly ignoring the look of
pleased expostulation with which Mrs. Conroy recognised
this fancied recognition of her tastes, "and then <i>Olly's
friends and thet teacher</i>, not being round like you and me
allez and used to it, <i>they</i> mightn't like it. And I've heerd
that the smell of nigger-head terbacker do git inter the
strings of a pianner and kinder stops the music. A pianner's
a mighty cur'us thing. I've heerd say they're as
dilikit and ailin' ez a child. Look in 'em and see them
little strings a twistin' and crossin' each other like the reins
of a six mule team, and it 'tain't no wonder they gets
mixed up often."</p>

<p>It was not Gabriel's way to notice his wife's manner very
closely, but if he had at that moment he might have
fancied that there were other instruments whose fine chords
were as subject to irritation and discordant disturbance.
Perhaps only vaguely conscious of some womanish sullenness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
on his wife's part, Gabriel would at such times disengage
himself as being the possible disorganising element,
and lounge away. His favourite place of resort was his
former cabin, now tenantless and in rapid decay, but which
he had refused to dispose of, even after the erection of
his two later dwellings rendered it an unnecessary and
unsightly encumbrance of his lands. He loved to linger
by the deserted hearth and smoke his pipe in solitude, not
from any sentiment, conscious or unconscious, but from a
force of habit, that was in this lonely man almost as
pathetic.</p>

<p>He may have become aware at this time that a certain
growing disparity of sentiment and taste which he had before
noticed with a vague pain and wonder, rendered his
gradual separation from Olly a necessity of her well-doing.
He had indeed revealed this to her on several occasions
with that frankness which was natural to him. He had
apologised with marked politeness to her music teacher,
who once invited him to observe Olly's proficiency, by saying
in general terms that he "took no stock in chunes. I
reckon it's about ez easy, Miss, if ye don't ring me in.
Thet chile's got to get on without thinkin' o' me&mdash;or my
'pinion&mdash;allowin' it was wuth thinkin' on." Once meeting
Olly walking with some older and more fashionable school
friends whom she had invited from Sacramento, he had
delicately avoided them with a sudden and undue consciousness
of his great bulk, and his slow moving intellect, painfully
sensitive to what seemed to him to be the preternatural
quickness of the young people, and turned into a by-path.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is possible that with the novelty of
her new situation, and the increased importance that wealth
brought to Olly, she had become more and more oblivious
of her brother's feelings, and perhaps less persistent in her
endeavours to draw him toward her. She knew that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
had attained an equal importance among his fellows from
this very wealth, and also a certain evident, palpable, superficial
respect which satisfied her. With her restless ambition
and the new life that was opening before her, his
slower old-fashioned methods, his absolute rusticity&mdash;that
day by day appeared more strongly in contrast to his
surroundings&mdash;began to irritate where it had formerly only
touched her sensibilities. From this irritation she at last
escaped by the unfailing processes of youth and the fascination
of newer impressions. And so, day by day and hour
by hour, they drifted slowly apart. Until one day Mrs.
Conroy was pleasantly startled by an announcement from
Gabriel, that he had completed arrangements to send Olly
to boarding-school in Sacramento. It was understood,
also, that this was only a necessary preliminary to the departure
of herself and husband for a long-promised tour
of Europe.</p>

<p>As it was impossible for one of Gabriel's simple nature
to keep his plans entirely secret, Olly was perfectly aware
of his intention, and prepared for the formal announcement,
which she knew would come in Gabriel's quaint serious way.
In the critical attitude which the child had taken toward
him, she was more or less irritated, as an older person
might have been, with the grave cautiousness with which
Gabriel usually explained that conduct and manner which
was perfectly apparent and open from the beginning. It
was during a long walk in which the pair had strayed among
the evergreen woods, when they came upon the little dismantled
cabin. Here Gabriel stopped. Olly glanced
around the spot and shrugged her shoulders. Gabriel, more
mindful of Olly's manner than he had ever been of any
other of her sex, instantly understood it.</p>

<p>"It ain't a purty place, Olly," he began, rubbing his
hands, "but we've had high ole times yer&mdash;you and me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
Don't ye mind the nights I used to kem up from the gulch
and pitch in to mendin' your gownds, Olly, and you asleep?
Don't ye mind that&mdash;ar dress I copper fastened?" and
Gabriel laughed loudly, and yet a little doubtfully.</p>

<p>Olly laughed too, but not quite so heartily as her brother,
and cast her eyes down upon her own figure. Gabriel
followed the direction of her glance. It was not perhaps
easy to re-create in the figure before him the outré little
waif who such a short time&mdash;such a long time&mdash;ago had sat
at his feet in that very cabin. It is not alone that Olly was
better dressed, and her hair more tastefully arranged, but
she seemed in some way to have become more refined
and fastidious&mdash;a fastidiousness that was plainly an out-growth
of something that she possessed but <i>he</i> did not. As
he looked at her, another vague hope that he had fostered&mdash;a
fond belief that as she grew taller she would come to
look like Grace, and so revive the missing sister in his
memory&mdash;this seemed to fade away before him. Yet it was
characteristic of the unselfishness of his nature, that he did
not attribute this disappointment to her alone, but rather to
some latent principle in human nature whereof he had been
ignorant. He had even gone so far as to invite criticism
on a hypothetical case from the sagacious Johnson. "It's
the difference atween human natur and brute natur," that
philosopher had answered promptly. "A purp's the same
purp allez, even arter it's a grown dorg, but a child ain't&mdash;it's
the difference atween reason and instink."</p>

<p>But Olly, to whom this scene recalled another circumstance,
did not participate in Gabriel's particular reminiscence.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember, Gabe," she said, quickly, "the
first night that sister July came here and stood right in that
very door? Lord! how flabergasted we was to be sure!
And if anybody'd told me, Gabe, that <i>she</i> was going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
marry <i>you</i>&mdash;I'd, I'd a knocked 'em down," she blurted out,
after hesitating for a suitable climax.</p>

<p>Gabriel, who in his turn did not seem to be particularly
touched with Olly's form of reminiscence, rose instantly
above all sentiment in a consideration of the proprieties.
"Ye shouldn't talk o' knockin' people down, Olly&mdash;it ain't
decent for a young gal," he said, quickly. "Not that I
mind it," he added, with his usual apology, "but allowin'
that some of them purty little friends o' yours or teacher
now, should hear ye! Sit down for a spell, Olly. I've
suthin' to tell ye."</p>

<p>He took her hand in his and made her sit beside him
on the rude stone that served as the old doorstep of the
cabin.</p>

<p>"Maybe ye might remember," he went on, lightly lifting
her hand in his, and striking it gently across his knee to
beget an easy confidential manner, "maybe ye might
remember that I allers allowed to do two things ef ever I
might make a strike&mdash;one was to give you a good schoolin'&mdash;the
other was to find Grace, if so be as she was above
the yearth. They waz many ways o' finding out&mdash;many
ways o' settin' at it, but they warn't <i>my</i> ways. I allus
allowed that ef thet child was in harkenin' distance o' the
reach o' my call, she'd hear me. I mout have took other
men to help me&mdash;men ez was sharp in them things, men
ez was in that trade&mdash;but I didn't. And why?"</p>

<p>Olly intimated by an impatient shake of her head that
she didn't know.</p>

<p>"Because she was that shy and skary with strangers.
Ye disremember how shy she was, Olly, in them days, for
ye was too young to notice. And then, not bein' shy
yourself, but sorter peart, free and promisskiss, ready and
able to keep up your end of a conversation with anybody,
and allus ez chipper as a jay-bird&mdash;why, ye don't kinder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
allow that fur Gracy as I do. And thar was reasons why
that purty chile should be shy&mdash;reasons ye don't understand
now, Olly, but reasons pow'ful and strong to such a
child as thet."</p>

<p>"Ye mean, Gabe," said the shamelessly direct Olly,
"that she was bashful, hevin' ran away with her bo."</p>

<p>That perplexity which wiser students of human nature
than Gabriel have experienced at the swift perception of
childhood in regard to certain things left him speechless.
He could only stare hopelessly at the little figure before
him.</p>

<p>"Well, wot did <i>you</i> do, Gabe? Go on!" said Olly,
impatiently.</p>

<p>Gabriel drew a long breath.</p>

<p>"Thar bein' certing reasons why Gracy should be
thet shy&mdash;reasons consarning propperty o' her deceased
parients," boldly invented Gabriel, with a lofty ignoring of
Olly's baser suggestion, "I reckoned that she should get
the first word from <i>me</i> and not from a stranger. I knowed
she warn't in Californy, or she'd hev seen them handbills I
issued five years ago. What did I do? Thar is a paper
wot's printed in New York, called the <i>Herald</i>. Thar is a
place in that thar paper whar they print notisses to people
that is fur, fur away. They is precious words from fathers
to their sons, from husbands to their wives, from brothers
to sisters, ez can't find each other, from"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"From sweethearts to thar bo's," said Olly, briskly; "I
know."</p>

<p>Gabriel paused in speechless horror.</p>

<p>"Yes," continued Olly. "They calls 'em 'Personals.'
Lord! I know all 'bout them. Gals get bo's by them,
Gabe!"</p>

<p>Gabriel looked up at the bright, arching vault above him.
Yet it did not darken nor split into fragments. And he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
hesitated. Was it worth while to go on? Was there anything
he could tell this terrible child&mdash;his own sister&mdash;which
she did not already know better than he?</p>

<p>"I wrote one o' them Pursonals," he went on to say,
doggedly, "in this ways." He paused, and fumbling in
his waistcoat pocket, finally drew out a well-worn newspaper
slip, and straightening it with some care from its
multitudinous enfoldings, read it slowly, and with that
peculiar patronising self-consciousness which distinguishes
the human animal in the rehearsal of its literary composition.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Ef G. C. will communicate with sufferin' and anxious friends, she
will confer a favour on ole Gabe. I will come and see her, and Olly
will rise up and welcome her. Ef G. C. is sick or don't want to
come she will write to G. C. G. C. is same as usual, and so is Olly.
All is well. Address G. C., One Horse Gulch, Californy&mdash;till further
notiss."</p></blockquote>

<p>"Read it over again," said Olly.</p>

<p>Gabriel did so, readily.</p>

<p>"Ain't it kinder mixed up with them G. C.'s?" queried
the practical Olly.</p>

<p>"Not for she," responded Gabriel, quickly, "that's just
what July said when I showed her the 'Pursonal.' But I
sed to her as I sez to you, it taint no puzzle to Gracy.
<i>She</i> knows ez our letters is the same. And ef it 'pears
queer to strangers, wots the odds? Thet's the idee ov a
'pursonal.' Howsomever, it's all right, Olly. Fur," he
continued, lowering his voice confidentially, and drawing
is sister closer to his side, "<i>it's bin ansered!</i>"</p>

<p>"By Grace?" asked Olly.</p>

<p>"No," said Gabriel, in some slight confusion, "not by
Grace, exactly&mdash;that is&mdash;but yer's the anser." He drew
from his bosom a small chamois-skin purse, such as
miners used for their loose gold, and extracted the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
precious slip. "Read it," he said to Olly, turning away
his head.</p>

<p>Olly eagerly seized and read the paper.</p>

<blockquote><p>"G. C.&mdash;Look no more for the missing one who will never return.
Look at home. Be happy.&mdash;P. A."</p></blockquote>

<p>Olly turned the slip over in her hands. "Is that all?"
she asked, in a higher key, with a rising indignation in her
pink cheeks.</p>

<p>"That's all," responded Gabriel; "short and shy&mdash;that's
Gracy, all over."</p>

<p>"Then all I got to say is it's mean!" said Olly, bringing
her brown fist down on her knee. "And that's wot I'd
say to that thar P. A.&mdash;that Philip Ashley&mdash;if I met him."</p>

<p>A singular look, quite unlike the habitual placid, good-humoured
expression of the man, crossed Gabriel's face as
he quietly reached out and took the paper from Olly's
hand.</p>

<p>"Thet's why I'm goin' off," he said, simply.</p>

<p>"Goin' off," repeated Olly.</p>

<p>"Goin' off&mdash;to the States. To New York," he responded,
"July and me. July sez&mdash;and she's a peart sort o' woman
in her way, ef not o' your kind, Olly," he interpolated,
apologetically, "but pow'ful to argyfy and plan, and she
allows ez New York 'ud nat'rally be the stampin' ground o'
sich a high-toned feller ez him. And that's why I want to
talk to ye, Olly. Thar's only two things ez 'ud ever part
you and me, dear, and one on 'em ez this very thing&mdash;it's
my dooty to Gracy, and the other ez my dooty to you. Et
ain't to be expected that when you oughter be gettin' your
edykation you'd be cavortin' round the world with me.
And you'll stop yer at Sacramento in a A-1 first-class
school, ontil I come back. Are ye hark'nin', dear?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Olly, fixing her clear eyes on her brother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>"And ye ain't to worrit about me. And it 'ud be as
well, Olly, ez you'd forget all 'bout this yer gulch, and the
folks. Fur yer to be a lady, and in bein' thet brother Gabe
don't want ennythin' to cross ye. And I want to say to
thet feller, Olly, 'Ye ain't to jedge this yer fammerly by me,
fur the men o' that fammerly gin'rally speakin' runs to size,
and ain't, so to speak, strong up yer,'" continued Gabriel,
placing his hands on his sandy curls; "'but thar's a little
lady in school in Californy ez is jest what Gracy would hev
bin if she'd had the schoolin'. And ef ye wants to converse
with her she kin give you pints enny time' And then I
brings you up, and nat'rally I reckon thet you ain't goin'
back on brother Gabe&mdash;in 'stronomy, grammar, 'rithmetic
and them things."</p>

<p>"But wot's the use of huntin' Grace if she says she'll
never return?" said Olly, sharply.</p>

<p>"Ye musn't read them 'pursonals' ez ef they was square.
They're kinder conundrums, ye know&mdash;puzzles. It says
G. C. will never return. Well, s'pose G. C. has another
name. Don't you see?"</p>

<p>"Married, maybe," said Olly, clapping her hands.</p>

<p>"Surely," said Gabriel, with a slight colour in his cheeks.
"Thet's so."</p>

<p>"But s'pose it doesn't mean Grace after all?" persisted
Olly.</p>

<p>Gabriel was for a moment staggered.</p>

<p>"But July sez it does," he answered, doubtfully.</p>

<p>Olly looked as if this evidence was not entirely satisfactory.</p>

<p>"But what does 'look at home' mean?" she continued.</p>

<p>"Thet's it," said Gabriel, eagerly. "Thet reads&mdash;'Look
at little Olly&mdash;ain't she there?' And thet's like Gracy&mdash;allus
thinkin' o' somebody else."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said Olly, "I'll stop yer, and let you go. But
wot are <i>you</i> goin' to do without me?"</p>

<p>Gabriel did not reply. The setting sun was so nearly
level with his eyes that it dazzled them, and he was fain to
hide them among the clustering curls of Olly, as he held
the girl's head in both his hands. After a moment he
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do ye want to know why I like this old cabin and this
yer chimbly, Olly?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Olly, whose eyes were also affected by
the sun, and who was glad to turn them to the object
indicated.</p>

<p>"It ain't because you and me hez sot there many and
many a day, fur that's suthin' that we ain't goin' to think
about any more. It's because, Olly, the first lick I ever
struck with a pick on this hill was just yer. And I raised
this yer chimbly with the rock. Folks thinks thet it was
over yonder in the slope whar I struck the silver lead, thet
I first druv a pick. But it warn't. And I sometimes
think, Olly, that I've had as much square comfort outer
thet first lick ez I'll ever get outer the lead yonder. But
come, Olly, come! July will be wonderin' whar you is,
and ther's a stranger yonder comin' up the road, and I
reckon I ain't ez fine a lookin' bo ez a young lady ez you
ez, orter to co-mand. Never mind, Olly, he needn't know
ez you and me is any relashuns. Come!"</p>

<p>In spite of Gabriel's precautionary haste, the stranger,
who was approaching by the only trail which led over the
rocky hillside, perceived the couple, and turned toward
them interrogatively. Gabriel was forced to stop, not,
however, without first giving a slight reassuring pressure to
Olly's hand.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me the way to the hotel&mdash;the Grand Conroy
House I think they call it?" the traveller asked politely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>He would have been at any time an awe-inspiring and
aggressive object to One Horse Gulch and to Gabriel, and
at this particular moment he was particularly discomposing.
He was elaborately dressed, buttoned and patent-leather
booted in the extreme limit of some bygone fashion, and
had the added effrontery of spotless ruffled linen. As
he addressed Gabriel he touched a tall black hat, sacred
in that locality to clergymen and gamblers. To add to
Gabriel's discomfiture, at the mention of the Grand
Conroy House he had felt Olly stiffen aggressively under
his hand.</p>

<p>"Foller this yer trail to the foot of the hill, and ye'll
strike Main Street; that'll fetch ye thar. I'd go with ye a
piece, but I'm imployed," said Gabriel, with infinite tact
and artfulness, accenting each word with a pinch of Olly's
arm, "imployed by this yer young lady's friends to see her
home, and bein' a partikler sort o' fammerly, they makes a
row when I don't come reg'lar. Axin' your parding, don't
they, Miss?" and to stop any possible retort from Olly
before she could recover from her astonishment, he had
hurried her into the shadows of the evergreen pines of
Conroy Hill.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

<h5>TRANSIENT GUESTS AT THE GRAND CONROY.</h5>


<p>The Grand Conroy Hotel was new, and had the rare
virtue of comparative cleanliness. As yet the odours of
bygone dinners, and forgotten suppers, and long dismissed
breakfasts had not possessed and permeated its halls and
passages. There was no distinctive flavour of preceding
guests in its freshly clothed and papered rooms. There
was a certain virgin coyness about it, and even the active<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
ministration of Mrs. Markle and Sal was delicately veiled
from the public by the interposition of a bar-keeper and
Irish waiter. Only to a few of the former <i>habitués</i> did
these ladies appear with their former frankness and informality.
There was a public parlour, glittering with gilt
framed mirrors and gorgeous with red plush furniture,
which usually froze the geniality of One Horse Gulch,
and repressed its larger expression, but there was a little
sitting-room beyond sacred to the widow and her
lieutenant Sal, where visitors were occasionally admitted.
Among the favoured few who penetrated this arcana was
Lawyer Maxwell. He was a widower, and was supposed
to have a cynical distrust of the sex that was at once a
challenge to them and a source of danger to himself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Markle was of course fully aware that Mrs. Conroy
had been Maxwell's client, and that it was while on a
visit to him she had met with the accident that resulted
in her meeting with Gabriel. Unfortunately Mrs. Markle
was unable to entirely satisfy herself if there had been any
previous acquaintance. Maxwell had declared to her that
to the best of his knowledge there had been none, and
that the meeting was purely accidental. He could do this
without violating the confidence of his client, and it is fair
to presume that upon all other matters he was loyally
uncommunicative. That Madame Devarges had consulted
him regarding a claim to some property was the only information
he imparted. In doing this, however, he once
accidentally stumbled, and spoke of Mrs. Devarges as
"Grace Conroy." Mrs. Markle instantly looked up. "I
mean Mrs. Conroy," he said hastily.</p>

<p>"Grace&mdash;that was his sister who was lost&mdash;wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Maxwell, demurely, "did he ever talk
much to you about her?"</p>

<p>"No-o," said Mrs. Markle, with great frankness, "he and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
me only talked on gin'ral topics; but from what Olly used
to let on, I reckon that sister was the only woman he ever
loved."</p>

<p>Lawyer Maxwell, who, with an amused recollection of
his extraordinary interview with Gabriel in regard to the
woman before him, was watching her mischievously, suddenly
became grave. "I guess you'll find, Mrs. Markle,
that his present wife amply fills the place of his lost sister,"
he said, more seriously than had intended.</p>

<p>"Never," said Mrs. Markle, quickly. "Not she&mdash;the
designin', crafty hussy!"</p>

<p>"I am afraid you are not doing her justice," said Maxwell,
wiping away a smile from his lips, after his characteristic
habit; "but then it's not strange that two bright, pretty
women are unable to admire each other. What reason
have you to charge <i>her</i> with being designing?" he asked
again, with a sudden return of his former seriousness.</p>

<p>"Why, her marryin' him," responded Mrs. Markle,
frankly; "look at that simple, shy, bashful critter, do you
suppose he'd marry her&mdash;marry any woman&mdash;that didn't
throw herself at his head, eh?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Markle's pique was so evident that even a philosopher
like Maxwell could not content himself with referring
it to the usual weakness of the sex. No man cares to have
a woman exhibit habitually her weakness for another man,
even when he possesses the power of restraining it. He
answered somewhat quickly as he raised his hand to his
mouth to wipe away the smile that, however, did not come.
"But suppose that you&mdash;and others&mdash;are mistaken in
Gabriel's character. Suppose all this simplicity and shyness
is a mask. Suppose he is one of the most perfect and
successful actors on or off the stage. Suppose he should
turn out to have deceived everybody&mdash;even his present
wife!"&mdash;and Lawyer Maxwell stopped in time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Markle instantly fired. "Suppose fiddlesticks and
flapjacks! I'd as soon think o' suspectin' thet child," she
said, pointing to the unconscious Manty. "You lawyers are
allus suspectin' what you can't understand!" She paused
as Maxwell wiped his face again. "What do you mean
anyway&mdash;why don't yer speak out? What do you know
of him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing! only it's as fair to say all this of him as
of her&mdash;on about the same evidence. For instance, here's
a simple, ignorant fellow"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"He ain't ignorant," interrupted Mrs. Markle, sacrificing
argument to loyalty.</p>

<p>"Well, this grown-up child! He discovers the biggest
lead in One Horse Gulch, manages to get the shrewdest
financier in California to manage it for him, and that too
after he has snatched up an heiress and a pretty woman
before the rest of 'em got a sight of her. That may be
simplicity; but my experience of guilelessness is that,
ordinarily, it isn't so lucky."</p>

<p>"They won't do him the least good, depend upon it,"
said Mrs. Markle, with the air of triumphantly closing the
argument.</p>

<p>It is very possible that Mrs. Markle's dislike was sustained
and kept alive by Sal's more active animosity, and the strict
espionage that young woman kept over the general movements
and condition of the Conroys. Gabriel's loneliness,
his favourite haunt on the hillside, the number and quality
of Mrs. Conroy's visitors, even fragments of conversation
held in the family circle, were all known to Sal, and redelivered
to Mrs. Markle with Sal's own colouring. It is
possible that most of the gossip concerning Mrs. Conroy
already hinted at, had its origin in the views and observations
of this admirable young woman, who did not confine
her confidences entirely to her mistress. And when one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
day a stranger and guest, staying at the Grand Conroy
House, sought to enliven the solemnity of breakfast by social
converse with Sal regarding the Conroys, she told him
nearly everything that she had already told Mrs. Markle.</p>

<p>I am aware that it is alleged that some fascinating quality
in this stranger's manner and appearance worked upon the
susceptible nature and loosened the tongue of this severe
virgin, but beyond a certain disposition to minister personally
to his wants, to hover around him archly with a greater
quantity of dishes than that usually offered the transient
guest, and to occasionally expatiate on the excellence of
some extra viand, there was really no ground for the report.
Certainly, the guest was no ordinary man; was quite unlike
the regular <i>habitués</i> of the house, and perhaps to some
extent justified this favouritism. He was young, sallow-faced,
with very white teeth and skin, yellow hands, and a
tropical, impulsive manner, which Miss Sarah Clark generally
referred to as "Eyetalian." I venture to transcribe
something of his outward oral expression.</p>

<p>"I care not greatly for the flapjack, nor yet for the dried
apples," said Victor, whom the intelligent reader has at
once recognised, "but a single cup of coffee sweetened by
those glances and offered by those fair hands&mdash;which I
kiss!&mdash;are to me enough. And you think that the Meestrees
Conroy does not live happily with her husband. Ah!
you are wise, you are wise, Mees Clark, I would not for
much money find myself under these criticism, eh?"</p>

<p>"Well, eyes bein' given to us to see with by the Lord's
holy will, and it ain't for weak creeturs like us to misplace
our gifts or magnify 'em," said Sal, in shrill, bashful confusion,
allowing an underdone fried egg to trickle from the
plate on the coat-collar of the unconscious Judge Beeswinger,
"I do say when a woman sez to her husband, ez
she's sworn to honour and obey, 'This yer's <i>my</i> house, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
this yer's <i>my</i> land, and yer kin git,' thar ain't much show
o' happiness thar. Ef it warn't for hearin' this with my own
ears, bein' thar accidental like, and in a sogial way, I
wouldn't hev believed it. And she allowin' to be a lady,
and afeared to be civil to certain folks ez is ez good ez she
and far better, and don't find it necessary to git married to
git a position&mdash;and could hev done it a thousand times
over ef so inclined. But folks is various and self praise is
open disgrace. Let me recommend them beans. The
pork, ez we allus kills ourselves fur the benefit o' transient
gests, bein' a speciality."</p>

<p>"It is of your kindness, Mees Clark, I am already full.
And of the pork I touch not, it is an impossibility," said
Victor, showing every tooth in his head. "It is much
painful to hear of this sad, sad affair. It is bad&mdash;and yet
you say he has riches&mdash;this man. Ah! the what is the
world. See, the great manner it has treated those! No, I
will not more. I am sufficient now. Ah! eh! what have
we here?"</p>

<p>He lowered his voice and eyes as a stranger&mdash;the antique
dandy Gabriel had met on Conroy's hill the evening before&mdash;rose
from some unnoticed seat at a side table, and unconcernedly
moved away. Victor instantly recognised the card
player of San Antonio, his former chance acquaintance of
Pacific Street, and was filled with a momentary feeling of
suspicion and annoyance. But Sal's <i>sotto voce</i> reply that
the stranger was a witness attending court seemed to be a
reasonable explanation, and the fact that the translator did
not seem to recognise him promptly relieved his mind.
When he had gone Sal returned to her confidences: "Ez
to his riches, them ez knows best hez their own say o' that.
Thar was a party yer last week&mdash;gents ez was free with
their money, and not above exchanging the time o' day
with working folk, and though it ain't often ez me or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
Sue Markle dips into conversation with entire strangers,
yet," continued Sal with parenthetical tact and courtesy,
"Eyetalians,&mdash;furriners in a strange land bein' an exception&mdash;and
and them gents let on thet thet vein o' silver on Conroy's
hill hed been surveyed and it wazent over a foot wide, and
would be played out afore a month longer, and thet old
Peter Dumphy knowed it, and hed sold out, and thet thet's
the reason Gabriel Conroy was goin' off&mdash;jest to be out o'
the way when the killapse comes."</p>

<p>"Gabriel! going away, Mees Sal? this is not possible!"
ejaculated the fascinating guest, breathing very hard, and
turning all his teeth in a single broadside upon the susceptible
handmaid. At any other moment, it is possible that
Sal might have been suspicious of the stranger's excitement,
but the fascination of his teeth held and possessed this
fluttering virgin.</p>

<p>"Ef thar ever waz a man ez had an angelic smile," she
intimated afterwards in confidence to Mrs. Markle, "it waz
thet young Eyetalian." She handed him several dishes,
some of them empty, in her embarrassment and rejoined
with an affectation of arch indignation, "Thank ye fur sayin'
'I lie,'&mdash;and it's my pay fur bein' a gossip and ez good
ez I send&mdash;but thar's Olympy Conroy packed away to
school fur six months, and thar's the new superintendent
ez is come up to take Gabriel's situation, and he a sittin'
in a grey coat next to ye a minit ago! Eh? And ye won't
take nothin' more? Appil or cranbear' pie?&mdash;our own
make? I'm afeerd ye ain't made out a dinner!" But
Victor had already risen hurriedly and departed, leaving Sal
in tormenting doubt whether she had not in her coquettish
indignation irritated the tropical nature of this sensitive
Italian. "I orter allowed fur his bein' a furriner and not
bin so free. Pore young man! I thought he did luk tuk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
back when I jest allowed that he said I lied." And with a
fixed intention of indicating her forgiveness and goodwill
the next morning by an extra dish, Sal retired somewhat
dejectedly to the pantry. She made a point, somewhat
later, of dusting the hall in the vicinity of Victor's room,
but was possibly disappointed to find the door open, and the
tenant absent. Still later, she imparted some of this interview
to Mrs. Markle with a certain air of fatigued politeness
and a suggestion that, in the interest of the house
solely, she had not repressed perhaps as far as maidenly
pride and strict propriety demanded, the somewhat extravagant
advances of the stranger. "I'm sure," she added,
briskly, "why he kept a lookin' and a talkin' at me in that
way, mind can't consave, and transients did notiss. And
if he did go off mad, why, he kin git over it." Having
thus delicately conveyed the impression of an ardent
Southern nature checked in its exuberance, she became
mysteriously reticent and gloomy.</p>

<p>It is probable that Miss Clark's theory of Gabriel's
departure was not original with her, or entirely limited to
her own experience. A very decided disapprobation of
Gabriel's intended trip was prevalent in the gulches and
bar-room. He quickly lost his late and hard-earned popularity;
not a few questioned his moral right to leave One
Horse Gulch until its property was put beyond a financial
doubt in the future. The men who had hitherto ignored
the proposition that he was in any way responsible for the
late improvement in business, now openly condemned him
for abandoning the position they declared he never had.
The <i>Silveropolis Messenger</i> talked vaguely of the danger of
"changing superintendents" at such a moment, and hinted
that the stock of the company would suffer. The rival
paper&mdash;for it was found that the interests of the town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
required a separate and distinct expression&mdash;had an editorial
on "absenteeism," and spoke, crushingly, of those
men who, having enriched themselves out of the resources
of One Horse Gulch, were now seeking to dissipate that
wealth in the excesses of foreign travel.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the humble object of this criticism, oblivious
in his humility of any public interest in his movements or
intentions, busied himself in preparations for his departure.
He had refused the offer of a large rent for his house from
the new superintendent, but had retained a trusty servant
to keep it with a view to the possible return of Grace.
"Ef thar mout ever come a young gal yet lookin' fur me,"
he said privately to his servant, "yer not to ax any questions,
partiklaly ef she looks sorter shy and bashful, but ye'll
gin her the best room in the house, and send to me by
igspress, and ye needn't say anythin' to Mrs. Conroy about
it." Observing the expression of virtuous alarm on the face
of the domestic&mdash;she was a married woman of some comeliness
who was not living with her husband on account of
his absurdly jealous disposition&mdash;he added hastily, "She's
a young woman o' proputty ez hez troubil about it, and
wishes to be kep' secret," and, having in this way thoroughly
convinced his handmaid of the vileness of his motives and
the existence of a dark secret in the Conroy household,
he said no more, but paid a flying visit to Olly, secretly,
packed away all the remnants of his deceased mother's
wardrobe, cut (God knows for what purpose) small patches
from the few old dresses that Grace had worn that were
still sacredly kept in his wardrobe, and put them in his
pocket-book; wandered in his usual lonely way on the hillside,
and spent solitary hours in his deserted cabin; avoided
the sharp advances of Mrs. Markle, who once aggressively
met him in his long post-prandial walks, as well as the shy
propinquity of his wife, who would fain have delayed him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
in her bower, and so having after the fashion of his sex
made the two women who loved him exceedingly uncomfortable,
he looked hopefully forward to the time when he
should be happy without either.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

<h5>IN WHICH MR. DUMPHY TAKES A HOLIDAY.</h5>


<p>It was a hot day on the California coast. In the memory
of the oldest American inhabitant its like had not been
experienced, and although the testimony of the Spanish
Californian was deemed untrustworthy where the interests
of the American people were concerned, the statement that
for sixty years there had been no such weather was accepted
without question. The additional fact, vouchsafed by Don
Pedro Peralta, that the great earthquake which shook down
the walls of the Mission of San Juan Bautista had been
preceded by a week of such abnormal meteorology, was
promptly suppressed as being of a quality calculated to
check immigration. Howbeit it was hot. The usual afternoon
trade-winds had pretermitted their rapid, panting
breath, and the whole coast lay, as it were, in the hush of
death. The evening fogs that always had lapped the wind-abraded
surfaces of the bleak seaward hills were gone too;
the vast Pacific lay still and glassy, glittering, but intolerable.
The outlying sand dunes, unmitigated by any breath
of air, blistered the feet and faces of chance pedestrians.
For once the broad verandahs, piazzas, and balconies of
San Francisco cottage architecture were consistent and
serviceable. People lingered upon them in shirt-sleeves,
with all the exaggeration of a novel experience. French
windows, that had always been barred against the fierce
afternoon winds, were suddenly thrown open; that brisk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
energetic step, with which the average San Franciscan
hurried to business or pleasure, was changed to an idle,
purposeless lounge. The saloons were crowded with
thirsty multitudes, the quays and wharves with a people
who had never before appreciated the tonic of salt air;
the avenues leading over the burning sand-hills to the
ocean all day were thronged with vehicles. The numerous
streets and by-ways, abandoned by their great scavenger,
the wind, were foul and ill-smelling. For twenty-four
hours business was partly forgotten; as the heat continued
and the wind withheld its customary tribute, there were
some changes in the opinions and beliefs of the people;
doubts were even expressed of the efficacy of the climate;
a few heresies were uttered regarding business and social
creeds, and Mr. Dumphy and certain other financial
magnates felt vaguely that if the thermometer continued
to advance the rates of interest must fall correspondingly.</p>

<p>Equal to even this emergency, Mr. Dumphy had sat in
his office all the morning, resisting with the full strength of
his aggressive nature any disposition on the part of his
his customers to succumb financially to the unusual weather.
Mr. Dumphy's shirt-collar was off; with it seemed to have
departed some of his respectability, and he was perhaps,
on the whole, a trifle less imposing than he had been.
Nevertheless, he was still dominant, in the suggestion of
his short bull neck, and two visitors who entered, observing
the <i>déshabillé</i> of this great man, felt that it was the proper
thing for them to instantly unbutton their own waistcoats
and loosen their cravats.</p>

<p>"It's hot," said Mr. Pilcher, an eminent contractor.</p>

<p>"You bet!" responded Mr. Dumphy. "Must be awful
on the Atlantic coast! People dying by hundreds of sun-stroke;
that's the style out there. Here there's nothing of
the kind! A man stands things here that he couldn't there."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>Having thus re-established the supremacy of the California
climate, Mr. Dumphy came directly to business.
"Bad news from One Horse Gulch!" he said, quickly.</p>

<p>As that was the subject his visitors came to speak about&mdash;a
fact of which Mr. Dumphy was fully aware&mdash;he added,
sharply, "What do you propose?"</p>

<p>Mr. Pilcher, who was a large stockholder in the Conroy
mine, responded, hesitatingly, "We've heard that the lead
opens badly."</p>

<p>"D&mdash;&mdash;n bad!" interrupted Dumphy. "What do you
propose?"</p>

<p>"I suppose," continued Mr. Pilcher, "the only thing to
do is to get out of it before the news becomes known."</p>

<p>"No!" said Dumphy, promptly. The two men stared
at each other. "No!" he continued, with a quick, short
laugh, which was more like a logical expression than a
mirthful emotion. "No, we must hold on, sir! Look
yer! there's a dozen men as you and me know, that we
could unload to to-morrow. Suppose we did? Well, what
happens? They go in on four hundred thousand&mdash;that's
about the figures we represent. Well. They begin to
examine and look around; them men, Pilcher"&mdash;(in Mr.
Dumphy's more inspired moods he rose above considerations
of the English grammar)&mdash;"them men want to know
what that four hundred thousand's invested in; they ain't
goin' to take our word after we've got their money&mdash;that's
human nature&mdash;and in twenty-four hours they find they're
sold! That don't look well for me nor you&mdash;does it?"</p>

<p>There was not the least assumption of superior honour
or integrity&mdash;indeed, scarcely any self-consciousness or
sentiment of any kind, implied in this speech&mdash;yet it
instantly affected both of these sharp business men, who
might have been suspicious of sentiment, with an impression
of being both honourable and manly. Mr. Pilcher's companion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
Mr. Wyck, added a slight embarrassment to his reception
of these great truths, which Mr. Dumphy noticed.</p>

<p>"No," he went on; "what we must do is this. Increase
the capital stock just as much again. That will enable us
to keep everything in our hands&mdash;news and all&mdash;and if it
should leak out afterwards, we have half a dozen others
with us to keep the secret. Six months hence will be time
to talk of selling; just now buying is the thing! You don't
believe it?&mdash;eh? Well, Wyck, I'll take yours at the figure
you paid. What do you say?&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>Mr. Wyck, more confused than appeared necessary, declared
his intention of holding on; Mr. Pilcher laughed,
Mr. Dumphy barked behind his hand.</p>

<p>"That offer's open for ninety days&mdash;will you take it?
No! Well, then, that's all!" and Mr. Dumphy turned
again to his desk. Mr. Pilcher took the hint, and drew
Mr. Wyck away.</p>

<p>"Devilish smart chap, that Dumphy!" said Pilcher, as
they passed out of the door.</p>

<p>"An honest man, by&mdash;&mdash;!" responded Wyck.</p>

<p>When they had gone Mr. Dumphy rang his bell. "Ask
Mr. Jaynes to come and see me at once. D&mdash;&mdash;n it, go
now! You must get there before Wyck does. Run!"</p>

<p>The clerk disappeared. In a few moments Mr. Jaynes,
a sharp but very youthful looking broker, entered the office
parlour. "Mr. Wyck will want to buy back that stock he
put in your hands this morning, Jaynes. I thought I'd tell
you, it's worth 50 advance now!"</p>

<p>The precocious youth grinned intelligently and departed.
By noon of that day it was whispered that notwithstanding
the rumours of unfavourable news from the Conroy mine,
one of the heaviest stockholders had actually bought back,
at an advance of $50 per share, some stock he had previously
sold. More than that, it was believed that Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
Dumphy had taken advantage of these reports, and was
secretly buying. In spite of the weather, for some few
hours there had been the greatest excitement.</p>

<p>Possibly from some complacency arising from this, possibly
from some singular relaxing in the atmosphere, Mr.
Dumphy at two o'clock shook off the cares of business and
abandoned himself to recreation&mdash;refusing even to take
cognisance of the card of one Colonel Starbottle, which
was sent to him with a request for an audience. At half-past
two he was behind a pair of fast horses, one of a
carriage-load of ladies and gentlemen, rolling over the
scorching sand-hills towards the Pacific, that lay calm and
cool beyond. As the well-appointed equipage rattled up
the Bush Street Hill, many an eye was turned with envy
and admiration toward it. The spectacle of two pretty
women among the passengers was perhaps one reason; the
fact that everybody recognised in the showy and brilliant
driver the celebrated Mr. Rollingstone, an able financier
and rival of Mr. Dumphy's, was perhaps equally potent.
For Mr. Rollingstone was noted for his "turnout," as well
as for a certain impulsive South Sea extravagance and
picturesque hospitality which Dumphy envied and at times
badly imitated. Indeed, the present excursion was one of
Mr. Rollingstone's famous <i>fetes champetres</i>, and the present
company was composed of the <i>élite</i> of San Francisco, and
made self-complacent and appreciative by an enthusiastic
Eastern tourist.</p>

<p>Their way lay over shifting sand dunes, now motionless
and glittering in the cruel, white glare of a California sky,
only relieved here and there by glimpses of the blue bay
beyond, and odd marine-looking buildings, like shells
scattered along the beach, as if they had been cast up and
forgotten by some heavy tide. Farther on, their road
skirted the base of a huge solitary hill, broken in outline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
by an outcrop of gravestones, sacred to the memory of
worthy pioneers who had sealed their devotion to the
"healthiest climate in the world" with their lives. Occasionally
these gravestones continued to the foot of the hill,
where, struggling with the drifting sand, they suggested a
half-exhumed Pompeii to the passing traveller. They were
the skeletons at the feast of every San Francisco pleasure-seeker,
the <i>memento mori</i> of every picnicing party, and were
visible even from the broad verandahs of the suburban
pavilions, where the gay and thoughtless citizen ate, drank,
and was merry. Part of the way the busy avenue was
parallel with another, up which, even at such times, occasionally
crept the lugubrious procession of hearse and
mourning coach to other pavilions, scarcely less crowded,
where there were "funeral baked meats," and sorrow and
tears. And beyond this again was the grey eternal sea,
and at its edge, perched upon a rock, and rising out of the
very jaws of the gushing breakers, a stately pleasure dome,
decreed by some speculative and enterprising San Francisco
landlord&mdash;the excuse and terminus of this popular
excursion.</p>

<p>Here Rollingstone drew up, and, alighting, led his party
into a bright, cheery room, whose windows gave upon the
sea. A few other guests, evidently awaiting them, were
mitigating their impatience by watching the uncouth
gambols of the huge sea-lions, who, on the rocks beyond,
offered a contrast to the engaging and comfortable interior
that was at once pleasant and exciting. In the centre of
the room a table overloaded with overgrown fruits and
grossly large roses somewhat ostentatiously proclaimed the
coming feast!</p>

<p>"Here we are!" said Mr. Dumphy, bustling into the
room with that brisk, business-like manner which his
friends fondly believed was frank cheerfulness, "and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
time, too!" he added, drawing out his watch. "Inside
of thirty minutes&mdash;how's that, eh?" He clapped his
nearest neighbour on the back, who, pleased with this
familiarity from a man worth five or six millions, did not
stop to consider the value of this celerity of motion in a
pleasure excursion on a hot day.</p>

<p>"Well!" said Rollingstone, looking around him, "you
all know each other, I reckon, or will soon. Mr. Dumphy,
Mr. Poinsett, Mr. Pilcher, Mr. Dyce, Mr. Wyck, Mrs.
Sepulvida and Miss Rosey Ringround, gentlemen; Mr.
and Mrs. Raynor, of Boston. There, now, that's through!
Dinner's ready. Sit down anywhere and wade in. No
formality, gentlemen&mdash;this is California."</p>

<p>There was, perhaps, some advantage in this absence of
ceremony. The guests almost involuntarily seated themselves
according to their preferences, and Arthur Poinsett
found himself beside Mrs. Sepulvida, while Mr. Dumphy
placed Miss Ringround&mdash;a pretty though boyish-looking
blonde, slangy in speech and fashionable in attire&mdash;on his
right hand.</p>

<p>The dinner was lavish and luxurious, lacking nothing but
restraint and delicacy. There was game in profusion, fat
but flavourless. The fruits were characteristic. The enormous
peaches were blowsy in colour and robust in fibre; the
pears were prodigious and dropsical, and looked as if they
wanted to be tapped; the strawberries were overgrown and
yet immature&mdash;rather as if they had been arrested on their
way to become pine-apples; with the exception of the
grapes, which were delicate in colour and texture, the fruit
might have been an ironical honouring by nature of Mr.
Dumphy's lavish drafts.</p>

<p>It is probable, however, that the irony was lost on the
majority of the company, who were inclined to echo the
extravagant praise of Mr. Raynor, the tourist. "Wonderful!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
wonderful!" said that gentleman; "if I had not seen
this I wouldn't have believed it. Why, that pear would
make four of ours."</p>

<p>"That's the way we do things here," returned Dumphy,
with the suggestion of being personally responsible for
these abnormal growths. He stopped suddenly, for he
caught Arthur Poinsett's eye. Mr. Dumphy ate little in
public, but he was at that moment tearing the wing of a
grouse with his teeth, and there was something so peculiar
and characteristic in the manner that Arthur looked up
with a sudden recollection in his glance. Dumphy put
down the wing, and Poinsett resume his conversation with
Mrs. Sepulvida. It was not of a quality that interruption
seriously impaired; Mrs. Sepulvida was a charming but
not an intellectual woman, and Mr. Poinsett took up the
lost thread of his discourse quite as readily from her eyes
as her tongue.</p>

<p>"To have been consistent, Nature should have left a
race of giants here," said Mr. Poinsett, meditatively. "I
believe," he added, more pointedly, and in a lower voice,
"the late Don José was not a large man."</p>

<p>"Whatever he was, he thought a great deal of me!"
pouted Mrs. Sepulvida.</p>

<p>Mr. Poinsett was hastening to say that if "taking
thought" like that could add a "cubit to one's stature," he
himself was in a fair way to become a son of Anak, when
he was interrupted by Miss Rosey&mdash;</p>

<p>"What's all that about big men? There are none here.
They're like the big trees. They don't hang around the coast
much! You must go to the mountains for your Goliahs."</p>

<p>Emboldened quite as much by the evident annoyance of
her neighbour as the amused look of Arthur Poinsett, she
went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have seen the pre-historic man!&mdash;the original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
athletic sharp! He is seven feet high, is as heavy as a
sea-lion, and has shoulders like Tom Hyer. He slings an
awful left. He's got blue eyes as tender as a seal's. He
has hair like Samson before that woman went back on
him. He's as brave as a lion and as gentle as a lamb.
He blushes like a girl, or as girls used to; I wish I could
start up such a colour on even double the provocation!"</p>

<p>Of course everybody laughed&mdash;it was the usual tribute of
Miss Rosey's speech&mdash;the gentlemen frankly and fairly, the
ladies perhaps a little doubtfully and fearfully. Mrs. Sepulvida,
following the amused eyes of Arthur, asked Miss
Rosey patronisingly where she had seen her phenomenon.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's no use, my dear, positively&mdash;no use. He's
married. These phenomena always get married. No, I
didn't see him in a circus, Mr. Dumphy, nor in a
menagerie, Mr. Dyce, but in a girl's school!"</p>

<p>Everybody stared; a few laughed as if this were an amusing
introduction to some possible joke from Miss Rosey.</p>

<p>"I was visiting an old schoolmate at Madame Eclair's
<i>Pension</i> at Sacramento; he was taking his little sister to
the same school," she went on, coolly, "so he told me. I
love my love with a G, for he is Guileless and Gentle.
His name is Gabriel, and he lives in a Gulch."</p>

<p>"Our friend the superintendent&mdash;I'm blessed," said
Dyce, looking at Dumphy.</p>

<p>"Yes; but not so very guileless," said Pilcher, "eh,
Dyce?"</p>

<p>The gentlemen laughed; the ladies looked at each other
and then at Miss Ringround. That fearless young woman
was equal to the occasion.</p>

<p>"What have you got against my giant? Out with it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," said Mr. Pilcher; "only your guileless,
simple friend has played the sharpest game on record in
Montgomery Street."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go on!" said Miss Rosey.</p>

<p>"Shall I?" asked Pilcher of Dumphy.</p>

<p>Dumphy laughed his short laugh. "Go on."</p>

<p>Thus supported, Mr. Pilcher assumed the ease of a
graceful <i>raconteur</i>. "Miss Rosey's guileless friend, ladies
and gentlemen, is the superintendent and shareholder in a
certain valuable silver mine in which Dumphy is largely
represented. Being about to leave the country, and
anxious to realise on his stock, he contracted for the sale
of a hundred shares at $1000 each, with our friend Mr.
Dyce, the stocks to be delivered on a certain date&mdash;ten
days ago. Instead of the stock, that day comes a letter
from Conroy&mdash;a wonderful piece of art&mdash;simple, ill-spelled,
and unbusiness-like, saying, that in consequence of recent
disappointment in the character and extent of the lead, he
shall not hold Dyce to his contract, but will release him.
Dyce, who has already sold that identical stock at a pretty
profit, rushes off to Dumphy's broker, and finds two hundred
shares held at $1200. Dyce smells a large-sized rat,
writes that he shall hold Gabriel to the performance of his
contract, makes him hand over the stock, delivers it in
time, and then loads up again with the broker's 200 at
$1200 <i>for a rise</i>. That rise don't come&mdash;won't come&mdash;for
that sale was <i>Gabriel's too</i>&mdash;as Dumphy can tell you.
There's guilelessness! There's simplicity! And it cleared
a hundred thousand by the operation."</p>

<p>Of the party none laughed more heartily than Arthur
Poinsett. Without analysing his feelings he was conscious
of being greatly relieved by this positive evidence of
Gabriel's shrewdness. And when Mrs. Sepulvida touched
his elbow, and asked if this were not the squatter who held
the forged grant, Arthur, without being conscious of any
special meanness, could not help replying with unnecessary
significance that it was.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe the whole dreadful story that Donna Dolores
told me," said she, "how he married the woman who personated
his sister, and all that&mdash;the deceitful wretch."</p>

<p>"I've got that letter here," continued Mr. Pilcher, drawing
from his pocket a folded piece of letter paper. "It's a
curiosity. If you'd like to see the documentary evidence
of your friend's guilelessness, here it is," he added, turning
to Miss Ringround.</p>

<p>Miss Rosey took the paper defiantly, and unfolded it, as
the others gathered round her, Mr. Dumphy availing himself
of that opportunity to lean familiarly over the arm of her
chair. The letter was written with that timid, uncertain
ink, peculiar to the illiterate effort, and suggestive of an
occasional sucking of the pen in intervals of abstraction
or difficult composition. Saving that characteristic, it is
reproduced literally below:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"1, Hoss Gulch, Argus the 10th.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;On acount of thar heving ben bad Luck in the Leed

away, you can send the sam to me in Care of Wels Farko &amp; Co., New
York Citty, witch is a grate favor and will be pade sure. G. C."</p></blockquote>

<p>"I don't care what you say, that's an honest letter," said
Miss Rosey, with a certain decision of character new to the
experience of her friends, "as honest and simple as ever was
written. You can bet your pile on that."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>No one spoke, but the smile of patronising superiority
and chivalrous toleration was exchanged by all the gentlemen
except Poinsett. Mr. Dumphy added to his smile his
short characteristic bark. At the reference to the writer's
sister, Mrs. Sepulvida shrugged her pretty shoulders and
looked doubtingly at Poinsett. But to her great astonishment
that gentleman reached across the table, took the letter,
and having glanced over it, said positively, "You are right,
Miss Rosey, it is genuine."</p>

<p>It was characteristic of Poinsett's inconsistency that this
statement was as sincere as his previous assent to the popular
suspicion. When he took the letter in his hand, he at
once detected the evident sincerity of its writer, and as
quickly recognised the quaint honesty and simple nature of
the man he had known. It was Gabriel Conroy, all over.
More than that, he even recalled an odd memory of Grace
in this frank directness and utter unselfishness of the brother
who so plainly had never forgotten her. That all this might
be even reconcilable with the fact of his marriage to the
woman who had personated the sister, Arthur easily comprehended.
But that it was his own duty, after he had impugned
Gabriel's character, to make any personal effort to
clear it, was not so plain. Nevertheless, he did not answer
Mrs. Sepulvida's look, but walked gravely to the window, and
looked out upon the sea, Mr. Dumphy, who, with the instincts
of jealousy, saw in Poinsett's remark only a desire to ingratiate
himself with Miss Rosey, was quick to follow his lead.</p>

<p>"It's a clear case of <i>quien sabe</i> anyway," he said to
the young lady, "and maybe you're right. Joe, pass the
champagne."</p>

<p>Dyce and Pilcher looked up inquiringly at their leader,
who glanced meaningly towards the open-mouthed Mr.
Raynor, whose astonishment at this sudden change in public
sentiment was unbounded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>"But look here," said that gentleman, "bless my soul!
if this letter is genuine, your friends here&mdash;these gentlemen&mdash;have
lost a hundred thousand dollars! Don't you see?
If this news is true, and this man's information is correct,
the stock really isn't worth"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a laugh from Messrs. Dyce and
Pilcher.</p>

<p>"That's so. It would be a devilish good thing on Dyce!"
said the latter, good-humouredly. "And as I'm in myself
about as much again, I reckon I should take the joke about
as well as he."</p>

<p>"But," continued the mystified Mr. Raynor, "do you
really mean to say that you have any idea this news is
true?"</p>

<p>"Yes," responded Pilcher, coolly.</p>

<p>"Yes," echoed Dyce, with equal serenity.</p>

<p>"You do?"</p>

<p>"We do."</p>

<p>The astonished tourist looked from the one to the other
with undisguised wonder and admiration, and then turned
to his wife. Had she heard it? Did she fully comprehend
that here were men accepting and considering an actual and
present loss of nearly a quarter of a million of dollars, as
quietly and indifferently as if it were a postage stamp!
What superb coolness! What magnificent indifference!
What supreme and royal confidence in their own resources.
Was this not a country of gods? All of which was delivered
in a voice that, although pitched to the key of matrimonial
confidence, was still entirely audible to the gods themselves.</p>

<p>"Yes, gentlemen," continued Pilcher; "it's the fortune
of war. T'other man's turn to-day, ours to-morrow. Can't
afford time to be sorry in this climate. A man's born again
here every day. Move along and pass the bottle."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>What was that?</p>

<p>Nothing, apparently, but a rattling of windows and
shaking of the glasses&mdash;the effect of a passing carriage or
children running on the piazza without. But why had they
all risen with a common instinct, and with faces bloodless
and eyes fixed in horrible expectancy? These were the
questions which Mr. and Mrs. Raynor asked themselves
hurriedly, unconscious of danger, yet with a vague sense of
alarm at the terror so plainly marked upon the countenances
of these strange, self-poised people, who, a
moment before, had seemed the incarnation of reckless
self-confidence, and inaccessible to the ordinary annoyances
of mortals. And why were these other pleasure-seekers
rushing by the windows, and was not that a lady fainting
in the hall? Arthur was the first to speak and tacitly
answer the unasked question.</p>

<p>"It was from east to west," he said, with a coolness that
he felt was affected, and a smile that he knew was not mirthful.
"It's over now, I think." He turned to Mrs. Sepulvida,
who was very white. "You are not frightened? Surely
this is nothing new to you? Let me help you to a glass
of wine."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sepulvida took it with a hysterical little laugh. Mrs.
Raynor, who was now conscious of a slight feeling of nausea,
did not object to the same courtesy from Mr. Pilcher, whose
hand shook visibly as he lifted the champagne. Mr.
Dumphy returned from the doorway, in which, to his own
and everybody's surprise, he was found standing, and took
his place at Miss Rosey's side. The young woman was
first to recover her reckless hilarity.</p>

<p>"It was a judgment on you for slandering Nature's noblest
specimen," she said, shaking her finger at the capitalist.</p>

<p>Mr. Rollingstone, who had returned to the head of his
table, laughed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>"But <i>what</i> was it?" gasped Mr. Raynor, making himself
at last heard above the somewhat pronounced gaiety of
the party.</p>

<p>"An earthquake," said Arthur, quietly.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>

<h5>MR. DUMPHY HAS NEWS OF A DOMESTIC CHARACTER.</h5>


<p>"An earthquake!" echoed Mr. Rollingstone, cheerfully, to
his guests; "now you've had about everything we have to
show. Don't be alarmed, madam," he continued to Mrs.
Raynor, who was beginning to show symptoms of hysteria,
"nobody ever was hurt by 'em."</p>

<p>"In two hundred years there hasn't been as many
persons killed by earthquakes in California as are struck
by lightning on your coast in a single summer," said Mr.
Dumphy.</p>

<p>"Never have 'em any stronger than this," said Mr.
Pilcher, with a comforting suggestion on there being an absolute
limitation of Nature's freaks on the Pacific coast.</p>

<p>"Over in a minute, as you see," said Mr. Dumphy, "and&mdash;hello!
what's that?"</p>

<p>In a moment they were on their feet, pale and breathless
again. This time Mr. Raynor and his wife among the
number. But it was only a carriage&mdash;driving away.</p>

<p>"Let us adjourn to the piazza," said Mr. Dumphy, offering
his arm to Mrs. Raynor with the air of having risen
solely for that purpose.</p>

<p>Mr. Dumphy led the way, and the party followed with
some celerity. Mrs. Sepulvida hung back a moment with
Arthur, and whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Take me back as soon as you can!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are not seriously alarmed?" asked Arthur.</p>

<p>"We are too near the sea here," she replied, looking toward
the ocean with a slight shudder. "Don't ask questions
now," she added, a little sharply. "Don't you see these
Eastern people are frightened to death, and they may overhear."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Sepulvida had not long to wait, for in spite of
the pointed asseverations of Messrs. Pilcher, Dyce, and
Dumphy, that earthquakes were not only harmless, but absolutely
possessed a sanitary quality, the piazzas were found
deserted by the usual pleasure-seekers, and even the eloquent
advocates themselves betrayed some impatience to
be once more on the open road.</p>

<p>A brisk drive of an hour put the party again in the highest
spirits, and Mr. and Mrs. Raynor again into the condition
of chronic admiration and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sepulvida and Mr. Poinsett followed in an open
buggy behind. When they were fairly upon their way,
Arthur asked an explanation of his fair companion's fear
of the sea.</p>

<p>"There is an old story," said Donna Maria, "that the
Point of Pines&mdash;you know where it is, Mr. Poinsett&mdash;was
once covered by a great wave from the sea that followed
an earthquake. But tell me, do you really think that letter
of this man Conroy is true?"</p>

<p>"I do," said Arthur, promptly.</p>

<p>"And that&mdash;there&mdash;is&mdash;a&mdash;prospect&mdash;that&mdash;the&mdash;stock
of this big mine may&mdash;de&mdash;pre&mdash;ciate in value?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;possibly&mdash;yes!"</p>

<p>"And if you knew that I had been foolish enough to
put a good deal of money in it, you would still talk to me
as you did the other day&mdash;down there?"</p>

<p>"I should say," responded Arthur, changing the reins
to his left hand that his right might be free for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
purpose&mdash;goodness knows what!&mdash;"I should say that I
am more than ever convinced that you ought to have some
person to look after you."</p>

<p>What followed this remarkable speech I really do not
know how to reconcile with the statement that Mrs.
Sepulvida made to the Donna Dolores a few chapters ago,
and I therefore discreetly refrain from transcribing it here.
Suffice it to say that the buggy did not come up with the
<i>char-à-banc</i> and the rest of the party until long after they
had arrived at Mr. Dumphy's stately mansion on Rincon
Hill, where another costly and elaborate collation was
prepared. Mr. Dumphy evidently was in spirits, and had
so far overcome his usual awe and distrust of Arthur, as
well as the slight jealousy he had experienced an hour or
so before, as to approach that gentleman with a degree of
cheerful familiarity that astonished and amused the self-sustained
Arthur&mdash;who perhaps at that time had more
reason for his usual conceit than before. Arthur, who
knew, or thought he knew, that Miss Ringround was only
coquetting with Mr. Dumphy for the laudable purpose of
making the more ambitious of her sex miserable, and that
she did not care for his person or position, was a good
deal amused at finding the young lady the subject of Mr.
Dumphy's sudden confidences.</p>

<p>"You see, Poinsett, as a man of business I don't go as
much into society as you do, but she seems to be a straight
up and down girl, eh?" he queried, as they stood together
in the vestibule after the ladies had departed. It is hardly
necessary to say that Arthur was positive and sincere in his
praise of the young woman. Mr. Dumphy by some obscure
mental process, taking much of the praise to himself, was
highly elated and perhaps tempted to a greater vinous
indulgence than was his habit. Howbeit the last bottle
of champagne seemed to have obliterated all past suspicion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
of Arthur, and he shook him warmly by the hand. "I
tell ye what now, Poinsett, if there are any points I can
give you don't you be afraid to ask for 'em. I can see what's
up between you and the widow&mdash;honour, you know&mdash;all
right, my boy&mdash;she's in the Conroy lode pretty deep, but
I'll help her out and you too! You've got a good thing
there&mdash;Poinsett&mdash;and I want you to realise. We understand
each other, eh? You'll find me a square man with
my friends, Poinsett. Pitch in&mdash;pitch in!&mdash;my advice to
you is to just pitch in and marry the widow. She's worth
it&mdash;you can realise on her. You see you and me's&mdash;so to
speak&mdash;ole pards, eh? You rek'leck ole times on Sweetwater,
eh? Well&mdash;if you mus' go, goo'-bi! I s'pose she's
waitin' for ye. Look you, Poinsy, d'ye see this yer posy in
my buttonhole? She give it to me. Rosey did! eh? ha!
ha! Won't tak' nothin' drink? Lesh open n'or bo'll. No?
Goori!" until struggling between disgust, amusement, and
self-depreciation, Arthur absolutely tore himself away from
the great financier and his degrading confidences.</p>

<p>When Mr. Dumphy staggered back into his drawing-room,
a servant met him with a card.</p>

<p>"The gen'lman says it's very important business, and he
must see you to-night," he said, hastily, anticipating the
oath and indignant protest of his master. "He says it's
your business, sir, and not his. He's been waiting here
since you came back, sir."</p>

<p>Mr. Dumphy took the card. It bore the inscription in
pencil, "Colonel Starbottle, Siskiyou, on important business."
Mr. Dumphy reflected a moment. The magical
word "business" brought him to himself. "Show him in&mdash;in
the office," he said savagely, and retired thither.</p>

<p>Anybody less practical than Peter Dumphy would have
dignified the large, showy room in which he entered as the
library. The rich mahogany shelves were filled with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
heterogeneous collection of recent books, very fresh, very
new and glaring as to binding and subject; the walls were
hung with files of newspapers and stock reports. There
was a velvet-lined cabinet containing minerals&mdash;all of them
gold or silver bearing. There was a map of an island that
Mr. Dumphy owned&mdash;there was a marine view, with a
representation of a steamship also owned by Mr. Dumphy.
There was a momentary relief from these facts in a very
gorgeous and badly painted picture of a tropical forest and
sea-beach, until inquiry revealed the circumstance that the
sugar-house in the corner under a palm-tree was "run" by
Mr. Dumphy, and that the whole thing could be had for
a bargain.</p>

<p>The stranger who entered was large and somewhat inclined
to a corpulency that was, however, restrained in expansion
by a blue frock coat, tightly buttoned at the waist, which
had the apparent effect of lifting his stomach into the higher
thoracic regions of moral emotion&mdash;a confusion to which
its owner lent a certain intellectual assistance. The Colonel's
collar was very large, open and impressive; his black silk
neckerchief loosely tied around his throat, occupying considerable
space over his shirt front, and expanding through
the upper part of a gilt-buttoned white waistcoat, lent itself
to the general suggestion that the Colonel had burst his
sepals and would flower soon. Above this unfolding the
Colonel's face, purple, aquiline-nosed, throttle-looking as to
the eye, and moist and sloppy-looking as to the mouth, up-tilted
above his shoulders. The Colonel entered with that
tiptoeing celerity of step affected by men who are conscious
of increasing corpulency. He carried a cane hooked over
his forearm; in one hand a large white handkerchief, and
in the other a broad-brimmed hat. He thrust the former
gracefully in his breast, laid the latter on the desk where
Mr. Dumphy was seated, and taking an unoffered chair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
himself, coolly rested his elbow on his cane in an attitude
of easy expectancy.</p>

<p>"Say you've got important business?" said Dumphy.
"Hope it is, sir&mdash;hope it is! Then out with it. Can't
afford to waste time any more here than at the Bank.
Come! What is it?"</p>

<p>Not in the least affected by Mr. Dumphy's manner,
whose habitual brusqueness was intensified to rudeness,
Colonel Starbottle drew out his handkerchief, blew his nose,
carefully returned apparently only about two inches of the
cambric to his breast, leaving the rest displayed like a ruffled
shirt, and began with an airy gesture of his fat white hand.</p>

<p>"I was here two hours ago, sir, when you were at the&mdash;er&mdash;festive
board. I said to the boy, 'Don't interrupt your
master. A gentleman worshipping at the shrine of Venus
and Bacchus and attended by the muses and immortals,
don't want to be interrupted.' Ged, sir, I knew a man in
Louisiana&mdash;Hank Pinckney&mdash;shot his boy&mdash;a little yellow
boy worth a thousand dollars&mdash;for interrupting him at a
poker party&mdash;and no ladies present! And the boy only
coming in to say that the gin house was in flames. Perhaps
you'll say an extreme case. Know a dozen such. So
I said, 'Don't interrupt him, but when the ladies have
risen, and Beauty, sir, no longer dazzles and&mdash;er&mdash;gleams,
and the table round no longer echoes the&mdash;er&mdash;light jest,
then spot him! And over the deserted board, with&mdash;er&mdash;social
glass between us, your master and I will have our
little confab.'"</p>

<p>He rose, and before the astonished Dumphy could interfere,
crossed over to a table where a decanter of whisky
and a carafe of water stood, and filling a glass half-full of
liquor, reseated himself and turned it off with an easy yet
dignified inclination towards his host.</p>

<p>For once only Mr. Dumphy regretted the absence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
dignity in his own manner. It was quite evident that his
usual brusqueness was utterly ineffective here, and he
quickly recognised in the Colonel the representative of a
class of men well known in California, from whom any
positive rudeness would have provoked a demand for satisfaction.
It was not a class of men that Mr. Dumphy had
been in the habit of dealing with, and he sat filled with
impotent rage, but wise enough to restrain its verbal expression,
and thankful that none of his late guests were present
to witness his discomfiture. Only one good effect was due
to his visitor. Mr. Dumphy through baffled indignation
and shame had become sober.</p>

<p>"No, sir," continued Colonel Starbottle, setting his glass
upon his knee, and audibly smacking his large lips. "No,
sir, I waited in the&mdash;er&mdash;ante-chamber until I saw you part
with your guests&mdash;until you bade&mdash;er&mdash;adieu to a certain
fair nymph&mdash;Ged, sir, I like your taste, and I call myself a
judge of fine women&mdash;'Blank it all,' I said to myself, 'Blank
it all, Star, you ain't goin' to pop out upon a man just as
he's ministering to Beauty and putting a shawl upon a pair
of alabaster shoulders like that!' Ha! ha! Ged, sir, I
remembered myself that in '43 in Washington at a party
at Tom Benton's I was in just such a position, sir. 'Are
you never going to get that cloak on, Star?' she says to
me&mdash;the most beautiful creature, the acknowledged belle of
that whole winter&mdash;'43, sir&mdash;as a gentleman yourself you'll
understand why I don't particularise&mdash;'If I had my way,
madam,' I said, 'I never would!' I did, blank me. But
you're not drinking, Mr. Dumphy, eh? A thimbleful, sir,
to our better acquaintance."</p>

<p>Not daring to trust himself to speak, Mr. Dumphy
shook his head somewhat impatiently, and Colonel Starbottle
rose. As he did so it seemed as if his shoulders had
suddenly become broader and his chest distended until his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
handkerchief and white waistcoat protruded through the
breast of his buttoned coat like a bursting grain of "pop
corn." He advanced slowly and with deliberate dignity to
the side of Dumphy.</p>

<p>"If I have intruded upon your privacy, Mr. Dumphy,"
he said, with a stately wave of his white hand, "if, as I
surmise, from your disinclination, sir, to call it by no
other name, to exchange the ordinary convivial courtesies
common between gentlemen, sir,&mdash;you are disposed to
resent any reminiscences of mine as reflecting upon the
character of the young lady, sir, whom I had the pleasure
to see in your company&mdash;if such be the case, sir, Ged!&mdash;I
am ready to retire now, sir, and to give you to-morrow, or
at any time, the satisfaction which no gentleman ever
refuses another, and which Culpepper Starbottle has never
been known to deny. My card, sir, you have already; my
address, sir, is St. Charles Hotel, where I and my friend,
Mr. Dumphy, will be ready to receive you."</p>

<p>"Look here," said Mr. Dumphy, in surly but sincere
alarm, "I don't drink because I've been drinking. No
offence, Mr. Starbottle. I was only waiting for you to
open what you had on your mind in the way of business,
to order up a bottle of <i>Cliquot</i> to enable us to better digest
it. Take your seat, Colonel. Bring champagne and two
glasses." He rose, and under pretence of going to the
sideboard, added in a lower tone to the servant who
entered, "Stay within call, and in about ten minutes bring
me some important message from the Bank&mdash;you hear?
A glass of wine with you, Colonel. Happy to make your
acquaintance! Here we go!"</p>

<p>The Colonel uttered a slight cough as if to clear away
his momentary severity, bowed with gracious dignity,
touched the glass of his host, drew out his handkerchief,
wiped his mouth, and seated himself once more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>"If my object," he began, with a wave of dignified
depreciation, "were simply one of ordinary business, I
should have sought you, sir, in the busy mart, and not
among your Lares and Penates, nor in the blazing lights of
the festive hall. I should have sought you at that temple
which report and common rumour says that you, sir, as
one of the favoured sons of Fortune, have erected to her
worship. In my intercourse with the gifted John C.
Calhoun I never sought him, sir, in the gladiatorial arena
of the Senate, but rather with the social glass in the
privacy of his own domicile. Ged, sir, in my profession,
we recognise some quality in our relations even when professional
with gentlemen that keep us from approaching
them like a Yankee pedlar with goods to sell!"</p>

<p>"What's your profession?" asked Mr. Dumphy.</p>

<p>"Until elected by the citizens of Siskiyou to represent
them in the legislative councils I practised at the bar.
Since then I have been open occasionally to retainers in
difficult and delicate cases. In the various intrigues that
arise in politics, in the more complicated relations of the
two sexes&mdash;in, I may say, the two great passions of mankind,
Ambition and Love, my services have, I believe,
been considered of value. It has been my office, sir, to
help the steed of vaulting ambition&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;over the
fence, and to dry the&mdash;er&mdash;tearful yet glowing cheek of
Beauty. But for the necessity of honour and secrecy in
my profession, sir, I could give you the names of some of
the most elegant women, and some of the first&mdash;the very
first men in the land as the clients of Culpepper
Starbottle."</p>

<p>"Very sorry," began Mr. Dumphy, "but if you're
expecting to put me among your list of clients, I"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Without taking the least notice of Dumphy's half-returned
sneer, Colonel Starbottle interrupted him coolly:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ged, sir!&mdash;it's out of the question, I'm retained on the
other side."</p>

<p>The sneer instantly faded from Dumphy's face, and a
look of genuine surprise took its place.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he said curtly.</p>

<p>Colonel Starbottle drew his chair beside Dumphy, and
leaning familiarly over his desk took Mr. Dumphy's own
penholder and persuasively emphasised the points of his
speech upon Mr. Dumphy's arm with the blunt end. "Sir,
when I say retained by the other side, it doesn't keep me
from doing the honourable thing with the defendant&mdash;from
recognising a gentleman and trying to settle this matter as
between gentlemen."</p>

<p>"But what's all this about? Who is your plaintiff?"
roared Dumphy, forgetting himself in his rage.</p>

<p>"Ged, sir&mdash;it's a woman&mdash;of course. Don't think I'm
accusing you of any political ambition. Ha! ha! No, sir.
You're like me! it's a woman&mdash;lovely woman&mdash;I saw it at
a glance! Gentlemen like you and me don't go through
to fifty years without giving some thought to these dear
little creatures. Sir, I despise a man who did. It's the
weakness of a great man, sir."</p>

<p>Mr. Dumphy pushed his chair back with the grim
deliberation of a man who had at last measured the
strength of his adversary and was satisfied to risk an
encounter.</p>

<p>"Look here, Colonel Starbottle, I don't know or care
who your plaintiff is. I don't know or care how she may
have been deceived or wronged or disappointed or bamboozled,
or what is the particular game that's up now.
But you're a man of the world, you say, and as a man of
the world and a man of sense, you know that no one in my
position ever puts himself in any woman's power. I can't
afford it! I don't pretend to be better than other men, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
I ain't a fool. That's the difference between me and your
clients!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but, my boy, that <i>is</i> the difference! Don't
you see? In other cases the woman's a beautiful woman,
a charming creature, you know. Ged, sometimes she's as
proper and pious as a nun, but then the relations, you see,
ain't legal! But hang it all, my boy, this is&mdash;YOUR
WIFE!"</p>

<p>Mr. Dumphy, with colourless cheeks, tried to laugh a
reckless scornful laugh. "My wife is dead!"</p>

<p>"A mistake&mdash;Ged, sir!&mdash;a most miserable mistake.
Understand me. I don't say that she hadn't ought to be!
Ged, sir, from the look that that little blue-eyed hussy gave
you an hour ago&mdash;there ain't much use of another woman
around, but the fact is that she <i>is</i> living. You thought she
was dead, and left her up there in the snow. She goes so
far as to say&mdash;you know how these women talk, Dumphy;
Ged, sir, they'll say anything when they get down on a man&mdash;she
says it ain't your fault if she wasn't dead! Eh?
Sho?"</p>

<p>"A message, sir, business of the Bank, very important,"
said Dumphy's servant, opening the door.</p>

<p>"Get out!" said Dumphy, with an oath.</p>

<p>"But, sir, they told me, sir"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Get out! will you?" roared Dumphy.</p>

<p>The door closed on his astonished face. "It's all&mdash;a&mdash;mistake,"
said Dumphy, when he had gone. "They died
of starvation&mdash;all of them&mdash;while I was away hunting help.
I've read the accounts."</p>

<p>Colonel Starbottle slowly drew from some vast moral
elevation in his breast pocket a well-worn paper. It
proved when open to be a faded, blackened, and be-thumbed
document in Spanish. "Here is the report of
the Commander of the Presidio who sent out the expedition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
You read Spanish? Well. The bodies of all the
other women were identified except your wife's. Hang it,
my boy, don't you see why she was excepted? She wasn't
there."</p>

<p>The Colonel darted a fat forefinger at his host and then
drew back, and settled his purpled chin and wattled
cheeks conclusively in his enormous shirt collar. Mr.
Dumphy sank back in his chair at the contact as if the
finger of Fate had touched him.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER V.</h4>

<h5>MRS. CONROY HAS AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR.</h5>


<p>The hot weather had not been confined to San Francisco.
San Pablo Bay had glittered, and the yellow currents of
the San Joaquin and Sacramento glowed sullenly with a
dull sluggish lava-like flow. No breeze stirred the wild
oats that drooped on the western slope of the Contra Costa
hills; the smoke of burning woods on the eastern hillsides
rose silently and steadily; the great wheat fields of the
intermediate valleys clothed themselves humbly in dust and
ashes. A column of red dust accompanied the Wingdam
and One Horse Gulch stage-coach, a pillar of fire by day
as well as by night, and made the fainting passengers look
longingly toward the snow-patched Sierras beyond. It
was hot in California; few had ever seen the like, and
those who had were looked upon as enemies of their race.
A rashly scientific man of Murphy's Camp who had a
theory of his own, and upon that had prophesied a continuance
of the probable recurrence of the earthquake
shock, concluded he had better leave the settlement until
the principles of meteorology were better recognised and
established.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>It was hot in One Horse Gulch&mdash;in the oven-like Gulch,
on the burning sands and scorching bars of the river. It
was hot even on Conroy's Hill, among the calm shadows
of the dark-green pines&mdash;on the deep verandahs of the
Conroy <i>cottage orné</i>. Perhaps this was the reason why
Mrs. Gabriel Conroy, early that morning after the departure
of her husband for the mill, had evaded the varnished
and white-leaded heats of her own house and sought the
more fragrant odours of the sedate pines beyond the hilltop.
I fear, however, that something was due to a mysterious
note which had reached her clandestinely the evening
before, and which, seated on the trunk of a prostrate pine,
she was now reperusing.</p>

<p>I should like to sketch her as she sat there. A broad-brimmed
straw hat covered her head, that although squared
a little too much at the temples for shapeliness, was still
made comely by the good taste with which&mdash;aided by a
crimping-iron&mdash;she had treated her fine-spun electrical
blonde hair. The heat had brought out a delicate dewy
colour in her usually pale face, and had heightened the
intense nervous brightness of her vivid grey eyes. From
the same cause, probably, her lips were slightly parted, so
that the rigidity that usually characterised their finely
chiselled outlines was lost. She looked healthier; the
long flowing skirts which she affected, after the fashion of
most <i>petite</i> women, were gathered at a waist scarcely as
sylph-like and unsubstantial as that which Gabriel first
clasped after the accident in the fateful cañon. She
seemed a trifle more languid&mdash;more careful of her personal
comfort, and spent some time in adjusting herself to the
inequalities of her uncouth seat with a certain pouting
peevishness of manner that was quite as new to her character
as it was certainly feminine and charming. She held
the open note in her thin, narrow, white-tipped fingers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
and glanced over it again with a slight smile. It read as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"At ten o'clock I shall wait for you at the hill near the Big Pine!
You shall give me an interview if you know yourself well. I say
beware! I am strong, for I am injured!&mdash;<span class="smcap">Victor.</span>"</p></blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Conroy folded the note again, still smiling, and
placed it carefully in her pocket. Then she sat patient,
her hands clasped lightly between her knees, the parasol
open at her feet&mdash;the very picture of a fond, confiding
tryst. Then she suddenly drew her feet under her, sideways,
with a quick, nervous motion, and examined the
ground carefully with sincere distrust of all artful lurking
vermin who lie in wait for helpless womanhood. Then
she looked at her watch.</p>

<p>It was five minutes past the hour. There was no sound
in the dim, slumbrous wood, but the far-off sleepy caw of
a rook. A squirrel ran impulsively halfway down the bark
of the nearest pine, and catching sight of her tilted parasol,
suddenly flattened himself against the bark, with outstretched
limbs, a picture of abject terror. A bounding
hare came upon it suddenly and had a palpitation of the
heart that he thought he really never should get over.
And then there was a slow crackling in the underbrush as
of a masculine tread, and Mrs. Conroy, picking up her
terrible parasol, shaded the cold fires of her grey eyes with
it and sat calm and expectant.</p>

<p>A figure came slowly and listlessly up the hill. When
within a dozen yards of her, she saw it was <i>not</i> Victor.
But when it approached nearer she suddenly started to her
feet with pallid cheeks and an exclamation upon her lips.
It was the Spanish translator of Pacific Street. She would
have flown, but on the instant he turned and recognised
her with a cry, a start, and a passion equal to her own.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
For a moment they stood glaring at each other breathless
but silent!</p>

<p>"Devarges!" said Mrs. Conroy, in a voice that was
scarcely audible. "Good God!"</p>

<p>The stranger uttered a bitter laugh. "Yes! Devarges!&mdash;the
man who ran away with you&mdash;Devarges the traitor!
Devarges the betrayer of your husband. Look at me!
You know me&mdash;Henry Devarges! Your husband's
brother!&mdash;your old accomplice&mdash;your lover&mdash;your dupe!"</p>

<p>"Hush," she said, imploringly glancing around through
the dim woods, "for God's sake, hush!"</p>

<p>"And who are you," he went on, without heeding her,
"which of the Mesdames Devarges is it now? Or have
you taken the name of the young sprig of an officer for
whom you deserted me and maybe in turn married? Or
did he refuse you even that excuse for your perfidy? Or
is it the wife and accomplice of this feeble-minded Conroy?
What name shall I call you? Tell me quick! Oh, I have
much to say, but I wish to be polite, madame; tell me to
whom I am to speak!"</p>

<p>Despite the evident reality of his passion and fury there
was something so unreal and grotesque in his appearance&mdash;in
his antique foppery, in his dyed hair, in his false teeth,
in his padded coat, in his thin strapped legs, that this
relentless woman cowered before him in very shame, not
of her crime but of her accomplice! "Hush," she said,
"call me your friend; I am always your friend, Henry.
Call me anything, but let me go from here. For God's sake,
do you hear? Not so loud! Another time and another
place I will listen," and she drew slowly back, until, scarce
knowing what he did, she had led him away from the place
of rendezvous toward the ruined cabin. Here she felt that
she was at least safe from the interruption of Victor. "How
came you here? How did you find out what had become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
of me? Where have you been these long years?" she asked
hastily.</p>

<p>Within the last few moments she had regained partially
the strange power that she had always exerted over all men
except Gabriel Conroy. The stranger hesitated, and then
answered in a voice that had more of hopelessness than
bitterness in its quality&mdash;</p>

<p>"I came here six years ago, a broken, ruined, and disgraced
man. I had no ambition but to hide myself from
all who had known me, from that brother whose wife I had
stolen, and whose home I had broken up&mdash;from you&mdash;you,
Julie! you and your last lover&mdash;from the recollection of
your double treachery!" He had raised his voice here,
but was checked by the unflinching eye and cautionary
gesture of the woman before him. "When you abandoned
me in St. Louis, I had no choice but death or a second
exile. I could not return to Switzerland, I could not live
in the sickening shadow of my crime and its bitter punishment.
I came here. My education, my knowledge of the
language stood me in good stead. I might have been a
rich man, I might have been an influential one, but I only
used my opportunities for the bare necessaries of life and
the means to forget my trouble in dissipation. I became
a drudge by day, a gambler by night. I was always a
gentleman. Men thought me crazy, an enthusiast, but they
learned to respect me. Traitor as I was in a larger trust,
no one doubted my honour or dared to question my
integrity. But bah! what is this to you? You!"</p>

<p>He would have turned from her again in very bitterness,
but in the act he caught her eye, and saw in it if not
sympathy, at least a certain critical admiration, that again
brought him to her feet. For despicable as this woman was,
she was pleased at this pride in the man she had betrayed,
was gratified at the sentiment that lifted him above his dyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
hair and his pitiable foppery, and felt a certain honourable
satisfaction in the fact that, even after the lapse of years,
he had proved true to her own intuitions of him.</p>

<p>"I had been growing out of my despair, Julie," he went
on, sadly; "I was, or believed I was, forgetting my fault,
forgetting even <i>you</i>, when there came to me the news of
my brother's death&mdash;by starvation. Listen to me, Julie.
One day there came to me for translation a document,
revealing the dreadful death of him&mdash;your husband, my
brother&mdash;do you hear?&mdash;by starvation! Driven from his
home by shame, he had desperately sought to hide himself
as I had&mdash;accepted the hardship of emigration&mdash;he, a
gentleman and a man of letters&mdash;with the boors and rabble
of the plains, had shared their low trials and their vulgar
pains, and died among them, unknown and unrecorded."</p>

<p>"He died as he had lived," said Mrs. Conroy, passionately,
"a traitor and a hypocrite; he died following the
fortunes of his paramour, an uneducated, vulgar rustic, to
whom, dying, he willed a fortune&mdash;this girl&mdash;Grace Conroy.
Thank God, I have the record! Hush! what's that?"</p>

<p>Whatever it was&mdash;a falling bough or the passing of some
small animal in the underbrush&mdash;it was past now. A dead
silence enwrapped the two solitary actors; they might have
been the first man and the first woman, so encompassed
were they by Nature and solitude.</p>

<p>"No," she went on, hurriedly, in a lower tone, "it was
the same old story&mdash;the story of that girl at Basle&mdash;the
story of deceit and treachery which brought us first together,
which made you, Henry, my friend, which turned our
sympathies into a more dangerous passion. You have
suffered. Ah, well, so have I. We are equal now."</p>

<p>Henry Devarges looked speechlessly upon his companion.
Her voice trembled, there were tears in her eyes,
that had replaced the burning light of womanly indignation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
He had come there knowing her to have been doubly
treacherous to her husband and himself. She had not
denied it. He had come there to tax her with an infamous
imposture, but had found himself within the last minute
glowing with sympathetic condemnation of his own brother,
and ready to accept the yet unoffered and perfectly explicable
theory of that imposture. More than that, he began
to feel that his own wrongs were slight in comparison with
the injuries received by this superior woman. The woman
who endeavours to justify herself to her jealous lover, always
has a powerful ally in his own self-love, and Devarges was
quite willing to believe that even if he had lost her love, he
had never at least been deceived. And the answer to the
morality of this imposture was before him. Here was she
married to the surviving brother of the girl she had personated.
Had he&mdash;had Dr. Devarges ever exhibited as noble
trust, as perfect appreciation of her nature and sufferings?
Had they not thrown away the priceless pearl of this
woman's love through ignorance and selfishness? You and
I, my dear sir, who are not in love with this most reprehensible
creature, will be quick to see the imperfect logic
of Henry Devarges, but when a man constitutes himself
accuser, judge, and jury of the woman he loves, he is very
apt to believe he is giving a verdict when he is only entering
a <i>nolle prosequi</i>. It is probably that Mrs. Conroy had
noticed this weakness in her companion, even with her
preoccupied fears of the inopportune appearance of Victor,
whom she felt she could have accounted for much better
in his absence. Victor was an impulsive person, and there
are times when this quality, generally adored by a self-restrained
sex, is apt to be confounding.</p>

<p>"Why did you come here to see me?" asked Mrs.
Conroy, with a dangerous smile. "Only to abuse me?"</p>

<p>"There is another grant in existence for the same land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
that you claim as Grace Conroy or Mrs. Conroy," returned
Devarges, with masculine bluntness, "a grant given prior
to that made to my brother Paul. A suspicion that some
imposture has been practised is entertained by the party
holding the grant, and I have been requested to get at the
facts."</p>

<p>Mrs. Conroy's grey eyes lightened. "And how were
these suspicions aroused?"</p>

<p>"By an anonymous letter."</p>

<p>"And you have seen it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; both it and the handwriting in portions of the
grant are identical."</p>

<p>"And you know the hand?"</p>

<p>"I do; it is that of a man now here, an old Californian&mdash;Victor
Ramirez!"</p>

<p>He fixed his eyes upon her; unabashed she turned her
own clear glance on his, and asked, with a dazzling smile&mdash;</p>

<p>"But does not your client know that, whether this grant
is a forgery or not, my husband's title is good?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but the sympathies of my client, as you call <i>her</i>,
are interested in the orphan girl Grace."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Mrs. Conroy, with the faintest possible
sigh, "your client, for whom you have travelled&mdash;how
many miles?&mdash;is a woman."</p>

<p>Half-pleased, but half-embarrassed, Devarges said "Yes."</p>

<p>"I understand," said Mrs. Conroy slowly. "A young
woman, perhaps a good, a <i>pretty</i> one! And you have said,
'I will prove this Mrs. Conroy an impostor,' and you are
here. Well, I do not blame you. You are a man. It is
well perhaps it is so."</p>

<p>"But, Julie, hear me!" interrupted the alarmed Devarges.</p>

<p>"No more!" said Mrs. Conroy, rising, and waving her
thin white hand, "I do not blame you. I could expect&mdash;I
deserve&mdash;no more! Go back to your client, sir, tell her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
that you have seen Julie Devarges, the impostor. Tell her
to go and press her claim, and that you will assist her.
Finish the work that the anonymous letter-writer has begun,
and earn your absolution for your crime and my folly.
Get your reward&mdash;you deserve it&mdash;but tell her to thank
God for having raised up to her better friends than Julie
Devarges ever possessed in the heyday of her beauty. Go!
Farewell! No; let me go, Henry Devarges, I am going
to my husband. He at least has known how to forgive
and protect a friendless and erring woman."</p>

<p>Before the astonished man could recover his senses,
elusive as a sunbeam she had slipped through his fingers
and was gone. For a moment only he followed the flash
of her white skirt through the dark aisles of the forest, and
then the pillared trees, crowding in upon each other, hid
her from view.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was well, for a moment later Victor Ramirez,
flushed, wild-eyed, dishevelled, and panting, stumbled
blindly upon the trail, and blundered into Devarges' presence.
The two men eyed each other in silence.</p>

<p>"A hot day for a walk!" said Devarges, with an ill-concealed
sneer.</p>

<p>"Vengeance of God! you are right, it is," returned
Victor. "And you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I have been fighting flies. Good-day!"</p>

<h4>CHAPTER VI.</h4>

<h5>GABRIEL DISCARDS HIS HOME AND WEALTH.</h5>


<p>I am sorry to say that Mrs. Conroy's expression as she fled
was not entirely consistent with the grieved and heart-broken
manner with which she had just closed the interview
with Henry Devarges. Something of a smile lurked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
about the corners of her thin lips as she tripped up the
steps of her house, and stood panting a little with the
exertion in the shadow of the porch. But here she suddenly
found herself becoming quite faint, and entering the apparently
empty house, passed at once to her boudoir, and
threw herself exhaustedly on the lounge with a certain
peevish discontent at her physical weakness. No one had
seen her enter; the Chinese servants were congregated in
the distant wash-house. Her housekeeper had taken advantage
of her absence to ride to the town. The unusual heat
was felt to be an apology for any domestic negligence.</p>

<p>She was very thoughtful. The shock she had felt on
first meeting Devarges was past; she was satisfied she still
retained an influence over him sufficient to keep him her
ally against Ramirez, whom she felt she now had reason to
fear. Hitherto his jealousy had only shown itself in
vapouring and bravado; she had been willing to believe
him capable of offering her physical violence in his insane
fury, and had not feared it, but this deliberately planned
treachery made her tremble. She would see Devarges
again; she would recite the wrongs she had received from
the dead brother and husband, and in Henry's weak attempt
to still his own conscience with that excuse, she could trust
to him to keep Ramirez in check, and withhold the exposure
until she and Gabriel could get away. Once out of the
country, she could laugh at them both; once away, she
could devote herself to win the love of Gabriel, without
which she had begun to feel her life and schemes had been
in vain. She would hurry their departure at once. Since
the report had spread affecting the value of the mine,
Gabriel, believing it true, had vaguely felt it his duty to
stand by his doubtful claim and accept its fortunes, and
had delayed his preparations. She would make him believe
that it was Dumphy's wish that he should go at once; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
would make Dumphy write him to that effect. She smiled
as she thought of the power she had lately achieved over
the fears of this financial magnate. She would do all this,
but for her physical weakness. She ground her teeth as
she thought of it: that at such a time she should be&mdash;and
yet a moment later a sudden fancy flashed across her mind,
and she closed her eyes that she might take in its delusive
sweetness more completely. It might be that it wanted
only this to touch his heart&mdash;some men were so strange&mdash;and
if it were, O God!&mdash;she stopped.</p>

<p>What was that noise? The house had been very quiet,
so still that she had heard a woodpecker tapping on its
roof. But now she heard distinctly the slow, heavy tread
of a man in one of the upper chambers, which had been
used as a lumber-room. Mrs. Conroy had none of the
nervous apprehension of her sex in regard to probable
ghosts or burglars&mdash;she had too much of a man's practical
pre-occupation for that, yet she listened curiously. It came
again. There was no mistaking it now. It was the tread
of the man with whom her thoughts had been busy&mdash;her
husband.</p>

<p>What was he doing here? In the few months of their
married life he had never been home before at this hour.
The lumber-room contained among other things the <i>disjecta
membra</i> of his old mining life and experience. He may
have wanted something. There was an old bag which she
remembered he said contained some of his mother's dresses.
Yet it was so odd that he should go there now. Any other
time but this. A terrible superstitious dread&mdash;a dread
that any other time she would have laughed to scorn, began
to creep over her. Hark! he was moving. She stopped
breathing.</p>

<p>The tread recommenced. It passed into the upper hall,
and came slowly down the stairs, each step recording itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
in her heart-beats. It reached the lower hall and seemed
to hesitate; then it came slowly along toward her door,
and again hesitated.</p>

<p>Another moment of suspense, and she felt she would
have screamed. And then the door slowly opened, and
Gabriel stood before her.</p>

<p>In one swift, intuitive, hopeless look she read her fate.
He knew all! And yet his eyes, except that they bore less
of the usual perplexity and embarrassment with which they
had habitually met hers, though grave and sad, had neither
indignation nor anger. He had changed his clothes to a
rough miner's blouse and trousers, and carried in one hand
a miner's pack, and in the other a pick and shovel. He
laid them down slowly and deliberately, and seeing her
eyes fixed upon them with a nervous intensity, began apologetically&mdash;</p>

<p>"They contains, ma'am, on'y a blanket and a few duds
ez I allus used to carry with me. I'll open it ef you say so.
But you know me, ma'am, well enough to allow that I'd
take nothin' outer this yer house ez I didn't bring inter it."</p>

<p>"You are going away," she said, in a voice that was not
audible to herself, but seemed to vaguely echo in her
mental consciousness.</p>

<p>"I be. Ef ye don't know why, ma'am, I reckon ez
you'll hear it from the same vyce ez I did. It's on'y the
squar thing to say afore I go, ez it ain't my fault nor hiz'n.
I was on the hill this mornin' in the ole cabin."</p>

<p>It seemed as if he had told her this before, so old and
self-evident the fact appeared.</p>

<p>"I was sayin' I woz on the hill, when I heerd vyces, and
lookin' out I seed you with a stranger. From wot ye know
o' me and my ways, ma'am, it ain't like me to listen to thet
wot ain't allowed for me to hear. And ye might hev stood
thar ontel now ef I hadn't seed a chap dodgin' round behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
the trees, spyin' and list'nin'. When I seed thet man
I knowed him to be a pore Mexican, whose legs I'd tended
yer in the Gulch mor'n a year ago. I went up to him, and
when he seed me he'd hev run. But I laid my hand onto
him&mdash;and&mdash;he stayed!"</p>

<p>There was something so unconsciously large and fine in
the slight gesture of this giant's hand as he emphasised his
speech, that even through her swiftly rising pride Mrs.
Conroy was awed and thrilled by it. But the next moment
she found herself saying&mdash;whether aloud or not she could
not tell&mdash;"If he had loved me, he would have killed him
then and there."</p>

<p>"Wot thet man sed to me&mdash;bein' flustered and savage-like,
along o' bein' choked hard to keep him from singin'
out and breakin' in upon you and thet entire stranger&mdash;ain't
fur me to say. Knowin' him longer than I do, I reckon
you suspect 'bout wot it was. That it ez the truth I read
it in your face now, ma'am, ez I reckon I might hev read it
off and on in many ways and vari's styles sens we've been
yer together, on'y I waz thet weak and ondecided yer."</p>

<p>He raised his hand to his forehead here, and with his
broad palm appeared to wipe away the trouble and perplexity
that had overshadowed it. He then drew a paper
from his breast.</p>

<p>"I've drawed up a little paper yer ez I'll hand over to
Lawyer Maxwell, makin' over back agin all ez I once hed
o' you and all ez I ever expect to hev. For I don't agree
with that Mexican thet wot was gi'n to Grace belongs to
me. I allow ez she kin settle thet herself, ef she ever
comes, and ef I know thet chile, ma'am, she ain't goin' tech
it with a two-foot pole. We've allus bin simple folks,
ma'am&mdash;though it ain't the squar thing to take me for a
sample&mdash;and oneddicated and common, but thar ain't a
Conroy ez lived ez was ever pinted for money, or ez ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
took more outer the kompany's wages than his grub and
his clothes."</p>

<p>It was the first time that he had ever asserted himself in
her presence, and even then he did it half apologetically,
yet with an unconscious dignity in his manner that became
him well. He reached down as he spoke and took up his
pick and his bundle, and turned to go.</p>

<p>"There is nothing then that you are leaving behind
you?" she asked.</p>

<p>He raised his eyes squarely to hers.</p>

<p>"No," he said, simply, "nothing."</p>

<p>Oh, if she could have only spoken! Oh, had she but
dared to tell him that he had left behind that which he
could not take away, that which the mere instincts of his
manhood would have stirred him to tenderness and mercy,
that which would have appealed to him through its very
helplessness and youth. But she dared not. That eloquence
which an hour before had been ready enough to
sway the feelings of the man to whom she had been faithless
and did not love, failed her now. In the grasp of her first
and only hopeless passion this arch-hypocrite had lost even
the tact of the simplest of her sex. She did not even
assume an indifference! She said nothing; when she
raised her eyes again he was gone.</p>

<p>She was wrong. At the front door he stopped, hesitated
a moment, and then returned slowly and diffidently to the
room. Her heart beat rapidly, and then was still.</p>

<p>"Ye asked just now," he said, falteringly, "ef thar was
anything ez I was leavin' behind. Thar is&mdash;ef ye'll overlook
my sayin' it. When you and me allowed to leave fur furrin
parts, I reckoned to leave thet housekeeper behind, and unbeknowed
to ye I gin her some money and a charge. I told
her thet if ever thet dear child&mdash;Sister Grace&mdash;came here,
thet she should take her in and do by her ez I would, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
let me know. Et may be a heap to ask, but ef it 'tain't too
much&mdash;I&mdash;I shouldn't&mdash;like&mdash;yer&mdash;to turn&mdash;thet innocent
insuspectin' chile away from the house thet she might take to
be mine. Ye needn't let on anythin' thet's gone&mdash;ye needn't
tell her what a fool I've been, but jest take her in and send
for me. Lawyer Maxwell will gin ye my address."</p>

<p>The sting recalled her benumbed life. She rose with a
harsh dissonant laugh and said, "Your wishes shall be fulfilled&mdash;if"&mdash;she
hesitated a moment&mdash;"<i>I</i> am here."</p>

<p>But he did not hear the last sentence, and was gone.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER VII.</h4>

<h5>WHAT PASSED UNDER THE PINE AND WHAT REMAINED
THERE.</h5>


<p>Ramirez was not as happy in his revenge as he had anticipated.
He had, in an instant of impulsive rage, fired his
mine prematurely, and, as he feared, impotently. Gabriel
had not visibly sickened, faded, nor fallen blighted under
the exposure of his wife's deceit. It was even doubtful, as
far as Ramirez could judge from his quiet reception of the
revelation, whether he would even call that wife to account
for it. Again, Ramirez was unpleasantly conscious that
this exposure had lost some of its dignity and importance by
being wrested from his as a <i>confession</i> made under pressure
or duress. Worse than all, he had lost the opportunity of
previously threatening Mrs. Conroy with the disclosure, and
the delicious spectacle of her discomfiture. In point of fact
his revenge had been limited to the cautious cowardice of
the anonymous letter-writer, who, stabbing in the dark,
enjoys neither the contemplation of the agonies of his
victim, nor the assertion of his own individual power.</p>

<p>To this torturing reflection a terrible suspicion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
Spanish translator, Perkins, was superadded. For Gabriel,
Ramirez had only that contempt which every lawless lover
has for the lawful husband of his mistress, while for Perkins
he had that agonising doubt which every lawless lover has for
every other man but the husband. In making this exposure
had he not precipitated a catastrophe as fatal to
himself as to the husband? Might they not both drive this
woman into the arms of another man? Ramirez paced the
little bedroom of the Grand Conroy Hotel, a prey to that
bastard remorse of all natures like his own,&mdash;the overwhelming
consciousness of opportunities for villany misspent.</p>

<p>Come what might he would see her again, and at once.
He would let her know that he suspected her relations with
this translator. He would tell her that he had written the
letter&mdash;that he had forged the grant&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A tap at the door recalled him to himself. It opened
presently to Sal, coy, bashful, and conscious. The evident
agitation of this young foreigner had to Sal's matter-of-fact
comprehension only one origin&mdash;a hopeless, consuming
passion for herself.</p>

<p>"Dinner hez bin done gone an hour ago," said that arch
virgin, "but I put suthin' by for ye. Ye was inquirin' last
night about them Conroys. I thought I'd tell ye thet Gabril
hez bin yer askin' arter Lawyer Maxwell&mdash;which he's off to
Sacramento&mdash;altho' one o' Sue Markle's most intymit friends
and steddeyist boarders!"</p>

<p>But Mr. Ramirez had no ear for Gabriel now.</p>

<p>"Tell to me, Mees Clark," he said, suddenly turning all
his teeth on her, with gasping civility, "where is this
Señor Perkins, eh?"</p>

<p>"Thet shiny chap&mdash;ez looks like a old turned alpacker
gownd!" said Sal; "thet man ez I can't abear," she continued,
with a delicately maidenly suggestion that Ramirez
need fear no rivalry from that quarter. "I don't mind&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
don't keer to know. He hezn't bin yer since mornin'. I
reckon he's up somewhar on Conroy's Hill. All I know ez
thet he sent a message yer to git ready his volise to put
aboard the Wingdam stage to-night. Are ye goin' with
him?"</p>

<p>"No," said Ramirez, curtly.</p>

<p>"Axin' yer parding for the question, but seein' ez he'd
got booked for two places, I tho't ez maybe ye'd got tired
o' plain mounting folks and mounting ways, and waz goin'
with him," and Sal threw an arch yet reproachful glance at
Ramirez.</p>

<p>"Booked for two seats," gasped Victor; "ah! for a
lady perhaps&mdash;eh, Mees Clark? for a lady?"</p>

<p>Sal bridled instantly at what might have seemed a suggestion
of impropriety on her part. "A lady&mdash;like his
imperance&mdash;indeed! I'd like to know who would demean
theirselves by goin' with the like o' he! But you're not
startin' out agin without your dinner, and it waitin' ye in
the oven? No? La! Mr. Ramirez, ye must be in luv!
I've heerd tell ez it do take away the appetite; not knowin'
o' my own experense, though it's little hez passed my lips
these two days, and only when tempted."</p>

<p>But before Sal could complete her diagnosis, Mr.
Ramirez gasped a few words of hasty excuse, seized his hat
and hurried from the room.</p>

<p>Leaving Sal a second time to mourn over the effect of
her coquettish playfulness upon the sensitive Italian nature,
Victor Ramirez, toiling through the heat and fiery dust
shaken from the wheels of incoming teams, once more
brushed his way up the long ascent of Conroy's Hill, and
did not stop until he reached its summit. Here he paused
to collect his scattered thoughts, to decide upon some plan
of action, to control the pulse of his beating temples,
quickened by excitement and the fatigue of the ascent, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
to wipe the perspiration from his streaming face. He must
see her at once; but how and where? To go boldly to
her house would be to meet her in the presence of Gabriel,
and that was no longer an object; besides, if she were with
this stranger it would not probably be there. By haunting
this nearest umbrage to the house he would probably intercept
them on their way to the Gulch, or overhear any other
conference. By lingering here he would avoid any interference
from Gabriel's cabin on the right, and yet be able
to detect the approach of any one from the road. The
spot that he had chosen was, singularly enough, in earlier
days, Gabriel's favourite haunt for the indulgence of his
noontide contemplation and pipe. A great pine, the
largest of its fellows, towered in a little opening to the
right, as if it had drawn apart for seclusion, and obeying
some mysterious attraction, Victor went toward it and
seated himself on an abutting root at its base. Here a
singular circumstance occurred, which at first filled him
with superstitious fear. The handkerchief with which he
had wiped his face&mdash;nay, his very shirt-front itself&mdash;suddenly
appeared as if covered with blood. A moment
later he saw that the ensanguined hue was only due to the
dust through which he had plunged, blending with the
perspiration that on the least exertion still started from
every pore of his burning skin.</p>

<p>The sun was slowly sinking. The long shadow of
Reservoir Ridge fell upon Conroy's Hill, and seemed to
cut down the tall pine that a moment before had risen
redly in the sunlight. The sounds of human labour slowly
died out of the Gulch below, the far-off whistle of teamsters
in the Wingdam road began to fail. One by one the red
openings on the wooded hillside opposite went out, as if
Nature were putting up the shutters for the day. With the
gathering twilight Ramirez became more intensely alert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
and watchful. Treading stealthily around the lone pine
tree, with shining eyes and gleaming teeth, he might have
been mistaken for some hesitating animal waiting for that
boldness which should come with the coming night.
Suddenly he stopped, and leaning forward peered into the
increasing shadow. Coming up the trail from the town was
a woman. Even at that distance and by that uncertain
light, Ramirez recognised the flapping hat and ungainly
stride. It was Sal&mdash;perdition! Might the devil fly away
with her! But she turned to the right with the trail that
wound toward Gabriel's hut and the cottage beyond, and
Victor breathed, or rather panted, more freely. And then
a voice at his very side thrilled him to his smallest fibre,
and he turned quickly. It was Mrs. Conroy, white, erect,
and truculent.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" she said, with a sharp,
quick utterance.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Ramirez, trembling with the passion
called up by the figure before him. "Hush! There is
one who has just come up the trail."</p>

<p>"What do I care who hears me now? You have made
caution unnecessary," she responded, sharply. "All the
world knows us now! and so I ask you again, what are
<i>you</i> doing here?"</p>

<p>He would have approached her nearer, but she drew
back, twitching her long white skirt behind her with a
single quick feminine motion of her hand, as if to save it
from contamination.</p>

<p>Victor laughed uneasily. "You have come to keep
your appointment; it is not my fault if I am late."</p>

<p>"I have come here because for the last half-hour I have
watched you from my verandah, coursing in and out
among the trees like a hound as you are! I have come to
whip you off my land as I would a hound. But I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
first a word or two to say to you as the man you have
assumed to be."</p>

<p>Standing there with the sunset glow over her erect,
graceful figure, in the pink flush of her cheek, in the cold
fires of her eyes, in all the thousand nameless magnetisms
of her presence, there was so much of her old power over
this slave of passion, that the scorn of her words touched
him only to inflame him, and he would have grovelled at
her feet could he have touched the thin three fingers that
she warningly waved at him.</p>

<p>"You wrong me, Julie, by the God of Heaven! I was
wild, mad, this morning&mdash;you understand&mdash;for when I
came to you I found you with another! I had reason,
Mother of God! I had reason for my madness, reason
enough; but I came in peace. Julie, I came in peace!"</p>

<p>"In peace," returned Mrs. Conroy, scornfully; "your
note was a peaceful one, indeed!"</p>

<p>"Ah! but I knew not how else to make you hear me.
I had news&mdash;news you understand, news that might save
you, for I came from the woman who holds the grant.
Ah! you will listen, will you not? For one moment only,
Julie, hear me, and I am gone."</p>

<p>Mrs. Conroy, with abstracted gaze, leaned against the
tree. "Go on," she said coldly.</p>

<p>"Ah! you will listen then!" said Victor, joyfully;
"and when you have listened you shall understand!
Well. First I have the fact that the lawyer for this woman
is the man who deserted the Grace Conroy in the
mountains&mdash;the man who was called Philip Ashley, but
whose real name is Poinsett."</p>

<p>"Who did you say?" said Mrs. Conroy, suddenly stepping
from the tree, and fining a pair of cruel eyes on Ramirez.</p>

<p>"Arthur Poinsett&mdash;an ex-soldier, an officer. Ah, you
do not believe&mdash;I swear to God it is so!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>"What has this to do with me?" she said scornfully,
resuming her position beside the pine. "Go on&mdash;or is this
all?"</p>

<p>"No, but it is much. Look you! he is the affianced of
a rich widow in the Southern Country, you understand?
No one knows his past. Ah, you begin to comprehend.
He does not dare to seek out the real Grace Conroy. He
shall not dare to press the claim of his client. Consequently,
he does nothing!"</p>

<p>"Is this all your news?"</p>

<p>"All!&mdash;ah, no. There is one more, but I dare not
speak it here," he said, glancing craftily around through
the slowly darkening wood.</p>

<p>"Then it must remain untold," returned Mrs. Conroy,
coldly; "for this is our last and only interview."</p>

<p>"But, Julie!"</p>

<p>"Have you done?" she continued, in the same tone.</p>

<p>Whether her indifference was assumed or not, it was
effective. Ramirez glanced again quickly around, and
then said, sulkily, "Come nearer, and I will tell you. Ah,
you doubt&mdash;you doubt? Be it so." But seeing that she
did not move, he drew toward the tree, and whispered&mdash;"Bend
here your head&mdash;I will whisper it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Conroy, evading his outstretched hand, bent her
head. He whispered a few words in her ear that were
inaudible a foot from the tree.</p>

<p>"Did you tell this to him&mdash;to Gabriel?" she asked,
fixing her eyes upon him, yet without change in her frigid
demeanour.</p>

<p>"No!&mdash;I swear to you, Julie, no! I would not have
told him anything, but I was wild, crazy. And he was a
brute, a great bear. He held me fast, here, so! I could
not move. It was a forced confession. Yes&mdash;Mother of
God&mdash;by force!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>Luckily for Victor the darkness hid the scorn that
momentarily flashed in the woman's eyes at this corroboration
of her husband's strength and the weakness of the
man before her. "And is this all that you have to tell
me?" she only said.</p>

<p>"All&mdash;I swear to you, Julie&mdash;all."</p>

<p>"Then listen, Victor Ramirez," she said, swiftly stepping
from the tree into the path before him, and facing him with
a white and rigid face. "Whatever was your purpose in
coming here, it has been successful! You have done all
that you intended, and more! The man whose mind you
came to poison&mdash;the man you wished to turn against me&mdash;has
gone!&mdash;has left me&mdash;left me never to return!&mdash;he
never loved me! Your exposure of me was to him a godsend,
for it gave him an excuse for the insults he has
heaped upon me, for the treachery he has always hidden in
his bosom!"</p>

<p>Even in the darkness she could see the self-complacent
flash of Victor's teeth, could hear the quick, hurried sound
of his breath as he bent his head toward her, and knew
that he was eagerly reaching out his hand for hers. He
would have caught her gesturing hand and covered it with
kisses, but that, divining his intention, without flinching
from her position, she whipped both her hands behind her.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;you are satisfied! You have had your say and
your way. Now I shall have mine. Do you suppose I
came here to-night to congratulate you? No I came here
to tell you that, insulted, outraged, and spurned as I have
been by my husband, Gabriel Conroy&mdash;cast off and
degraded as I stand here to-night&mdash;<i>I love him!</i> Love him
as I never loved any man before; love him as I never
shall love any man again; love him as I hate you! Love
him so that I shall follow him wherever he goes, if I have
to drag myself after him on my knees. His hatred is more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
precious to me than your love. Do you hear me, Victor
Ramirez? That is what <i>I</i> came here to tell you. More
than that&mdash;listen! The secret you have whispered to me
just now, whether true or false, I shall take to him. I will
help him to find his sister. I will make him love me yet if
I sacrifice you, everybody, my own life, to do it! Do you
hear that, Victor Ramirez, you dog!&mdash;you Spanish mongrel!&mdash;you
half-breed. Oh, grit your teeth there in the
darkness&mdash;I know you&mdash;grit your teeth as you did to-day
when Gabriel held you squirming under his thumb! It
was a fine sight, Victor&mdash;worthy of the manly Secretary
who stole a dying girl's papers!&mdash;worthy of the valiant
soldier who abandoned his garrison to a Yankee pedlar
and his mule! Oh, I know you, sir, and have known you
from the first day I made you my tool&mdash;my dupe! Go on,
sir, go on&mdash;draw your knife, do! I am not afraid,
coward! I shall not scream, I promise you! Come
on!"</p>

<p>With an insane, articulate gasp of rage and shame, he
sprang toward her with an uplifted knife. But at the same
instant she saw a hand reach from the darkness and fall
swiftly upon his shoulder, saw him turn and with an oath
struggle furiously in the arms of Devarges, and without
waiting to thank her deliverer, or learn the result of his
interference, darted by the struggling pair and fled.</p>

<p>Possessed only by a single idea, she ran swiftly to her
home. Here she pencilled a few hurried lines, and called
one of her Chinese servants to her side.</p>

<p>"Take this, Ah Fe, and give it to Mr. Conroy. You
will find him at Lawyer Maxwell's, or if not there he will
tell you where he has gone. But you must find him. If
he has left town already, you must follow him. Find him
within an hour and I'll double that"&mdash;she placed a gold
piece in his hand. "Go at once."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

<p>However limited might have been Ah Fe's knowledge of
the English language, there was an eloquence in the
woman's manner that needed no translation. He nodded
his head intelligently, said, "Me shabbe you&mdash;muchee
quick," caused the gold piece and the letter to instantly
vanish up his sleeve, and started from the house in a brisk
trot. Nor did he allow any incidental diversion to interfere
with the business in hand. The noise of struggling
in the underbrush on Conroy's Hill and a cry for help only
extracted from Ah Fe the response, "You muchee go-to-hellee&mdash;no
foolee me!" as he trotted unconcernedly by.
In half an hour he had reached Lawyer Maxwell's office.
But the news was not favourable. Gabriel had left an
hour before, they knew not where. Ah Fe hesitated a
moment, and then ran quickly down the hill to where a
gang of his fellow-countrymen were working in a ditch at
the roadside. Ah Fe paused, and uttered in a high recitative
a series of the most extraordinary ejaculations, utterly
unintelligible to the few Americans who chanced to be
working near. But the effect was magical; in an instant
pick and shovel were laid aside, and before the astonished
miners could comprehend it the entire gang of Chinamen
had dispersed, and in another instant were scattered over
the several trails leading out of One Horse Gulch, except
one.</p>

<p>That one was luckily taken by Ah Fe. In half an hour
he came upon the object of his search, settled on a boulder
by the wayside, smoking his evening pipe. His pick,
shovel, and pack lay by his side. Ah Fe did not waste
time in preliminary speech or introduction. He simply
handed the missive to his master, and instantly turned his
back upon him and departed. In another half hour every
Chinaman was back in the ditch, working silently as if
nothing had happened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>

<p>Gabriel laid aside his pipe and held the letter a moment
hesitatingly between his finger and thumb. Then opening
it, he at once recognised the small Italian hand with which
his wife had kept his accounts and written from his dictation,
and something like a faint feeling of regret overcame
him as he gazed at it, without taking the meaning of the
text. And then, with the hesitation, repetition, and audible
utterance of an illiterate person, he slowly read the
following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I was wrong. You have left something behind you&mdash;a secret that
as you value your happiness, you must take with you. If you come to
Conroy's Hill within the next two hours you shall know it, for I shall
not enter that house again, and leave there to-night for ever. I do not
ask you to come for the sake of your wife, but for the sake of a woman
she once personated. You will come because you love Grace, not because
you care for         <span class="smcap">Julie</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>There was but one fact that Gabriel clearly grasped in
this letter. That was, that it referred to some news of
Grace. That was enough. He put away his pipe, rose,
shouldered his pack and pick, and deliberately retraced
his steps. When he reached the town, with the shame-facedness
of a man who had just taken leave of it for ever,
he avoided the main thoroughfare, but did this so clumsily
and incautiously, after his simple fashion, that two or three
of the tunnel-men noticed him ascending the hill by an
inconvenient and seldom used by-path. He did not stay
long, however, for in a short time&mdash;some said ten, others
said fifteen minutes&mdash;he was seen again, descending rapidly
and recklessly, and crossing the Gulch disappeared in the
bushes, at the base of Bald Mountain.</p>

<p>With the going down of the sun that night, the temperature
fell also, and the fierce, dry, desert heat that had filled
the land for the past few days, fled away before a fierce
wind which rose with the coldly rising moon, that, during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
the rest of the night, rode calmly over the twisting tops of
writhing pines on Conroy's Hill, over the rattling windows
of the town, and over the beaten dust of mountain roads.
But even with the night the wind passed too, and the sun
arose the next morning upon a hushed and silent landscape.
It touched, according to its habit, first the tall top of the
giant pine on Conroy's Hill, and then slid softly down its
shaft until it reached the ground. And there it found
Victor Ramirez, with a knife thrust through his heart, lying
dead!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>A DIP.</i></h3>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

<h5>MR. HAMLIN'S RECREATION CONTINUED.</h5>


<p>When Donna Dolores after the departure of Mrs. Sepulvida
missed the figure of Mr. Jack Hamlin from the plain before
her window, she presumed he had followed that lady and
would have been surprised to have known that he was at
that moment within her castle, drinking <i>aguardiente</i> with
no less a personage than the solemn Don Juan Salvatierra.
In point of fact, with that easy audacity which distinguished
him, Jack had penetrated the courtyard, gained the hospitality
of Don Juan without even revealing his name and
profession to that usually ceremonious gentleman, and after
holding him in delicious fascination for two hours, had
actually left him lamentably intoxicated, and utterly
oblivious of the character of his guest. Why Jack did not
follow up his advantage by seeking an interview with the
mysterious <i>Señora</i> who had touched him so deeply I cannot
say, nor could he himself afterwards determine. A sudden
bashfulness and timidity which he had never before experienced
in his relations with the sex, tied his own tongue,
while Don Juan with the garrulity which inebriety gave to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
his, poured forth the gossip of the Mission and the household.
It is possible also that a certain vague hopelessness,
equally novel to Jack, sent him away in lower spirits than
he came. It is not remarkable that Donna Dolores knew
nothing of the visit of this guest, until three days afterwards,
for during that time she was indisposed and did not leave
her room, but it <i>was</i> remarkable that on learning it she flew
into a paroxysm of indignation and rage that alarmed Don
Juan and frightened her attendants.</p>

<p>"And why was <i>I</i> not told of the presence of this strange
<i>Americano</i>? Am I a child, holy St. Anthony! that I am to
be kept in ignorance of my duty as the hostess of the Blessed
Trinity, or are you, Don Juan, my dueña? A brave <i>caballero</i>,
who, I surmise from your description, is the same that protected
me from insult at Mass last Sunday, and he is not to
'kiss my hand?' Mother of God! And his name&mdash;you
have forgotten?"</p>

<p>In vain Juan protested that the strange <i>caballero</i> had not
requested an audience, and that a proper maidenly spirit
would have prevented the Donna from appearing, unsought.</p>

<p>"Better that I should have been thought forward&mdash;and
these <i>Americanos</i> are of different habitude, my uncle&mdash;than
that the Blessed Trinity should have been misrepresented
by the guzzling of <i>aguardiente</i>!"</p>

<p>Howbeit, Mr. Hamlin had not found the climate of San
Antonio conducive to that strict repose that his physician
had recommended, and left it the next day with an accession
of feverish energy that was new to him. He had idled
away three days of excessive heat at Sacramento, and on
the fourth had flown to the mountains and found himself
on the morning of the first cool day at Wingdam.</p>

<p>"Anybody here I know?" he demanded of his faithful
henchman, as Pete brought in his clothes, freshly brushed
for the morning toilette.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, sah!"</p>

<p>"Nor want to, eh?" continued the cynical Jack, leisurely
getting out of bed.</p>

<p>Pete reflected. "Dere is two o' dese yar Yeastern
tourists&mdash;dem folks as is goin' round inspectin' de country&mdash;down
in de parlour. Jess come over from de Big Trees.
I reckon dey's some o' de same party&mdash;dem Frisco chaps&mdash;Mass
Dumphy and de odders haz been unloadin' to.
Dey's mighty green, and de boys along de road has been
fillin' 'em up. It's jess so much water on de dried apples
dat Pete Dumphy's been shovin' into 'em."</p>

<p>Jack smiled grimly. "I reckon you needn't bring up
my breakfast, Pete, I'll go down."</p>

<p>The party thus obscurely referred to by Pete, were Mr.
and Mrs. Raynor, who had been "doing" the Big Trees,
under the intelligent guidance of a San Francisco editor
who had been deputised by Mr. Dumphy to represent
Californian hospitality. They were exceedingly surprised
during breakfast by the entrance of a pale, handsome,
languid gentleman, accurately dressed, whose infinite neatness
shamed their own bedraggled appearance, and who,
accompanied by his own servant, advanced and quietly
took a seat opposite the tourists and their guide. Mrs.
Raynor at once became conscious of some negligence in
her toilette, and after a moment's embarrassment excused
herself and withdrew. Mr. Raynor, impressed with the
appearance of the stranger, telegraphed his curiosity by
elbowing the editor, who, however, for some reason best
known to himself, failed to respond. Possibly he recognised
the presence of the notorious Mr. Jack Hamlin in
the dark-eyed stranger, and may have had ample reasons
for refraining from voicing the popular reputation of that
gentleman before his face, or possibly he may have been
inattentive. Howbeit, after Mr. Hamlin's entrance he pretermitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
the hymn of California praise and became reticent
and absorbed in his morning paper. Mr. Hamlin waited
for the lady to retire, and then, calmly ignoring the presence
of any other individual, languidly drew from his pocket a
revolver and bowie-knife, and placing them in an easy
habitual manner on either side of his plate, glanced carelessly
over the table, and then called Pete to his side.</p>

<p>"Tell them," said Jack, quietly, "that I want some <i>large</i>
potatoes: ask them what they mean by putting those little
things on the table. Tell them to be quick. Is your rifle
loaded?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sah," said Pete, promptly, without relaxing a
muscle of his serious ebony face.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;take it along with you."</p>

<p>But here the curiosity of Mr. Raynor, who had been just
commenting on the really enormous size of the potatoes,
got the best of his prudence. Failing to make his companion
respond to his repeated elbowings, he leaned over
the table toward the languid stranger. "Excuse me, sir,"
he said, politely, "but did I understand you to say that
you thought these potatoes <i>small</i>&mdash;that there are really
larger ones to be had?"</p>

<p>"It's the first time," returned Jack gravely, "that I ever
was insulted by having a <i>whole</i> potato brought to me. I
didn't know it was possible before. Perhaps in this part
of the country the vegetables are poor. I'm a stranger to
this section. I take it you are too. But because I am a
stranger I don't see why I should be imposed upon."</p>

<p>"Ah, I see," said the mystified Raynor, "but if I might
ask another question&mdash;you'll excuse me if I'm impertinent&mdash;I
noticed that you just now advised your servant to take
his gun into the kitchen with him; surely"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pete," interrupted Mr. Hamlin, languidly, "is a good
nigger. I shouldn't like to lose him! Perhaps you're right&mdash;maybe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
I am a little over-cautious. But when a man has
lost two servants by gunshot wounds inside of three months,
it makes him careful."</p>

<p>The perfect unconcern of the speaker, the reticence of
his companion, and the dead silence of the room in which
this extraordinary speech was uttered, filled the measure of
Mr. Raynor's astonishment.</p>

<p>"Bless my soul! this is most extraordinary. I have seen
nothing of this," he said, appealing in dumb show to his
companion.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamlin followed the direction of his eyes. "Your
friend is a Californian and knows what we think of any
man who lies, and how most men resent such an imputation,
and I reckon he'll endorse me!"</p>

<p>The editor muttered a hasty assent that seemed to cover
Mr. Hamlin's various propositions, and then hurriedly withdrew,
abandoning his charge to Mr. Hamlin. What advantage
Jack took of this situation, what extravagant accounts
he gravely offered of the vegetation in Lower California, of
the resources of the country, of the reckless disregard of
life and property, do not strictly belong to the record of
this veracious chronicle. Notwithstanding all this, Mr.
Raynor found Mr. Hamlin an exceedingly fascinating companion,
and later, when the editor had rejoined them, and
Mr. Hamlin proceeded to beg that gentleman to warn Mr.
Raynor against gambling as the one seductive, besetting
sin of California, alleging that it had been the ruin of both
the editor and himself, the tourist was so struck with the
frankness and high moral principle of his new acquaintance
as to insist upon his making one of their party, an invitation
that Mr. Hamlin might have accepted but for the intervention
of a singular occurrence.</p>

<p>During the conversation he had been curiously impressed
by the appearance of a stranger who had entered and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
modestly and diffidently taken a seat near the door. To
Mr. Hamlin this modesty and diffidence appeared so curiously
at variance with his superb physique, and the exceptional
strength and power shown in every muscle of his
body, that with his usual audacity he felt inclined to go
forward and inquire "what was his little game?" That he
was lying in wait to be "picked up"&mdash;the reader must
really excuse me if I continue to borrow Mr. Hamlin's expressive
vernacular&mdash;that his diffidence and shyness was a
deceit and intended to entrap the unwary, he felt satisfied,
and was proportionably thrilled with a sense of admiration
for him. That a rational human being who held such a
hand should be content with a small <i>ante</i>, without "raising
the other players,"&mdash;but I beg the fastidious reader's forgiveness.</p>

<p>He was dressed in the ordinary miner's garb of the
Southern mines, perhaps a little more cleanly than the
average miner by reason of his taste, certainly more picturesque
by reason of his statuesque shapeliness. He wore
a pair of white duck trousers, a jumper or loose blouse of
the same material, with a low-folded sailor's collar and
sailor-knotted neckerchief, which displayed, with an unconsciousness
quite characteristic of the man, the full, muscular
column of his sunburnt throat, except where it was hidden
by a full, tawny beard. His long, sandy curls fell naturally
and equally on either side of the centre of his low, broad
forehead. His fair complexion, although greatly tanned
by exposure, seemed to have faded lately as by sickness
or great mental distress, a theory that had some confirmation
in the fact that he ate but little. His eyes were
downcast, or, when raised, were so shy as to avoid critical
examination. Nevertheless his mere superficial exterior
was so striking as to attract the admiration of others besides
Mr. Hamlin; to excite the enthusiastic attention of Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
Raynor, and to enable the editor to offer him as a fair
type of the mining population. Embarrassed at last by a
scrutiny that asserted itself even through his habitual
unconsciousness and pre-occupation, the subject of this
criticism arose and returned to the hotel verandah, where
his pack and mining implements were lying. Mr. Hamlin,
who for the last few days had been in a rather exceptional
mood, for some occult reason which he could not explain,
felt like respecting the stranger's reserve, and quietly lounged
into the billiard-room to wait for the coming of the stage-coach.
As soon as his back was turned the editor took
occasion to offer Mr. Raynor his own estimate of Mr.
Hamlin's character and reputation, to correct his misstatements
regarding Californian resources and social habits,
and to restore Mr. Raynor's possibly shaken faith in California
as a country especially adapted to the secure investment
of capital.</p>

<p>"As to the insecurity of life," said the editor, indignantly,
"it is as safe here as in New York or Boston. We admit
that in the early days the country was cursed by too many
adventurers of the type of this very gambler Hamlin, but
I will venture to say that you will require no better refutation
of these calumnies than this very miner whom you
admired. He, sir, is a type of our mining population;
strong, manly, honest, unassuming, and perfectly gentle
and retiring. We are proud, sir, we admit, of such men&mdash;eh?
Oh, that's nothing&mdash;only the arrival of the up-stage!"</p>

<p>It certainly was something more. A momentarily increasing
crowd of breathless men were gathered on the
verandah before the window and were peering anxiously
over each other's head toward a central group, among
which towered the tall figure of the very miner of whom
they had been speaking. More than that, there was a
certain undefined, restless terror in the air, as when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
intense conscious passion or suffering of one or two men
communicates itself vaguely without speech, sometimes
even without visible sign to others. And then Yuba Bill,
the driver of the Wingdam coach, strode out from the
crowd into the bar-room, drawing from his hands with an
evident effort his immense buckskin gloves.</p>

<p>"What's the row, Bill?" said half-a-dozen voices.</p>

<p>"Nothin'," said Bill, gruffly; "only the Sheriff of Calaveras
ez kem down with us hez nabbed his man jest in his
very tracks."</p>

<p>"When, Bill?"</p>

<p>"Right yer&mdash;on this very verandy&mdash;furst man he
seed!"</p>

<p>"What for?" "Who?" "What hed he bin doin'?" "Who
is it?" "What's up?" persisted the chorus.</p>

<p>"Killed a man up at One Horse Gulch, last night," said
Bill, grasping the decanter which the attentive bar-keeper
had, without previous request, placed before him.</p>

<p>"Who did he kill, Bill?"</p>

<p>"A little Mexican from 'Frisco by the name o' Ramirez."</p>

<p>"What's the man's name that killed him&mdash;the man that
you took?"</p>

<p>The voice was Jack Hamlin's.</p>

<p>Yuba Bill instantly turned, put down his glass, wiped his
mouth with his sleeve, and then deliberately held out his
great hand with an exhaustive grin. "Dern my skin, ole
man, if it ain't you! And how's things, eh? Yer lookin'
a little white in the gills, but peart and sassy, ez usual.
Heerd you was kinder off colour, down in Sacramento lass
week. And it's you, ole fell, and jest in time! Bar-keep&mdash;hist
that pizen over to Jack. Here to ye agin, ole man!
But I'm glad to see ye!"</p>

<p>The crowd hung breathless over the two men&mdash;awestruck
and respectful. It was a meeting of the gods&mdash;Jack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
Hamlin and Yuba Bill. None dare speak. Hamlin
broke the silence at last, and put down his glass.</p>

<p>"What," he asked, lazily, yet with a slight colour on his
cheek, "did you say was the name of the chap that fetched
that little Mexican?"</p>

<p>"Gabriel Conroy," said Bill.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

<h5>MR. HAMLIN TAKES A HAND.</h5>


<p>The capture had been effected quietly. To the evident
astonishment of his captor, Gabriel had offered no resistance,
but had yielded himself up with a certain composed
willingness, as if it were only the preliminary step to the
quicker solution of a problem that was sure to be solved.
It was observed, however, that he showed a degree of
caution that was new to him&mdash;asking to see the warrant,
the particulars of the discovery of the body, and utterly
withholding that voluble explanation or apology which all
who knew his character confidently expected him to give,
whether guilty or innocent&mdash;a caution which, accepted by
them as simply the low cunning of the criminal, told
against him. He submitted quietly to a search that,
however, disclosed no concealed weapon or anything of
import. But when a pair of handcuffs were shown him,
he changed colour, and those that were nearest to him saw
that he breathed hurriedly, and hesitated in the first words
of some protest that rose to his lips. The sheriff, a man of
known intrepidity, who had the rapid and clear intuition
that comes with courageous self-possession noticed it also,
and quietly put the handcuffs back in his pocket.</p>

<p>"I reckon there's no use for 'em here; ef <i>you're</i> willin'
to take the risks, <i>I</i> am."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>

<p>The eyes of the two men met, and Gabriel thanked him.
In that look he recognised and accepted the fact that on a
motion to escape he would be instantly killed.</p>

<p>They were to return with the next stage, and in the
interval Gabriel was placed in an upper room, and securely
guarded. Here, falling into his old apologetic manner, he
asked permission to smoke a pipe, which was at once
granted by his good-humoured guard, and then threw himself
at full length upon the bed. The rising wind rattled
the windows noisily, and entering tossed the smoke-wreaths
that rose from his pipe in fitful waves about the room.
The guard, who was much more embarrassed than his
charge, was relieved of an ineffectual attempt to carry on
a conversation suitable to the occasion by Gabriel's simple
directness&mdash;</p>

<p>"You needn't put yourself out to pass the time o' day
with me," he said, gently, "that bein' extry to your reg'lar
work. Ef you hev any friends ez you'd like to talk to in
your own line, invite 'em in, and don't mind me."</p>

<p>But here the guard's embarrassment was further relieved
by the entrance of Joe Hall, the sheriff.</p>

<p>"There's a gentleman here to speak with you," he said
to Gabriel, "he can stay until we're ready to go." Turning
to the guard, he added, "You can take a chair outside
the door in the hall. It's all right, it's the prisoner's
counsel."</p>

<p>At the word Gabriel looked up. Following the sheriff,
Lawyer Maxwell entered the room. He approached
Gabriel, and extended with grave cordiality a hand that
had apparently wiped from his mouth the last trace of
mirthfulness at the door.</p>

<p>"I did not expect to see you again so soon, Gabriel, but
as quickly as the news reached me, and I heard that our
friend Hall had a warrant for you, I started after him. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
would have got here before him, but my horse gave out."
He paused, and looked steadily at Gabriel. "Well!"</p>

<p>Gabriel looked at him in return, but did not speak.</p>

<p>"I supposed you would need professional aid," he went
on, with a slight hesitation, "perhaps <i>mine</i>&mdash;knowing that
I was aware of some of the circumstances that preceded
this affair."</p>

<p>"Wot circumstances?" asked Gabriel, with the sudden
look of cunning that had before prejudiced his captors.</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, Gabriel," said Maxwell, rising with
a gesture of impatience, "don't let us repeat the blunder
of our first interview. <i>This</i> is a serious matter; <i>may be</i>
very serious to you. Think a moment. Yesterday you
sought my professional aid to deed to your wife all your
property, telling me that you were going away never to
return to One Horse Gulch. I do not ask you now <i>why</i>
you did it. I only want you to reflect that I am just now
the only man who knows that circumstance&mdash;a circumstance
that I can tell you as a lawyer is somewhat important in
the light of the crime that you are now charged with."</p>

<p>Maxwell waited for Gabriel to speak, wiping away as he
waited the usual smile that lingered around his lips. But
Gabriel said nothing.</p>

<p>"Gabriel Conroy," said Lawyer Maxwell, suddenly dropping
into the vernacular of One Horse Gulch, "are you a
fool?"</p>

<p>"Thet's so," said Gabriel, with the simplicity of a man
admitting a self-evident proposition, "Thet's so; I reckon
I are."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder," said Maxwell, again swiftly turning
upon him, "if you were!" He stopped, as if ashamed
of his abruptness, and said more quietly and persuasively,
"Come, Gabriel, if you won't confess to <i>me</i>, I suppose that
I must to <i>you</i>. Six months ago I thought you an impostor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
Six months ago the woman who is now your wife charged
you with being an impostor; with assuming a name and
right that did not belong to you; in plain English, said
that you had set yourself up as Gabriel Conroy, and that
she, who was Grace Conroy, the sister of the real Gabriel,
knew that you lied. She substantiated all this by proofs;
hang it," continued Maxwell, appealing in dumb show to
the walls, "there isn't a lawyer living as wouldn't have said
it was a good case, and been ready to push it in any court.
Under these circumstances I sought you, and you remember
how. You know the result of that interview. I
can tell you now that if there ever was a man who palpably
confessed to guilt when he was innocent, <i>you</i> were that
man. Well, after your conduct there was explained by
Olly, without, however, damaging the original evidence
against you, or prejudicing her rights, this woman came to
me and said that she had discovered that you were the
man who had saved her life at the risk of your own, and
that for the present she could not, in delicacy, push her
claim. When afterwards she told me that this gratitude
had&mdash;well, ripened into something more serious, and that
she had engaged herself to marry you, and so condone your
offence, why, it was woman-like and natural, and I suspected
nothing. I believed her story&mdash;believed she had a
case. Yes, sir; the last six months I have looked upon
you as the creature of that woman's foolish magnanimity.
I could see that she was soft on you, and believed that you
had fooled her. I did, hang me! There, if you confess
to being a fool, I do to having been an infernal sight bigger
one."</p>

<p>He stopped, erased the mirthful past with his hand, and
went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"I began to suspect something when you came to me
yesterday with this story of your going away, and this disposal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
of your property. When I heard of the murder of
this stranger&mdash;one of your wife's witnesses to her claim&mdash;near
your house, your own flight, and the sudden disappearance
of your wife, my suspicions were strengthened.
And when I read this note from your wife, delivered to you
last night by one of her servants, and picked up early this
morning near the body, my suspicions were confirmed."</p>

<p>As he finished he took from his pocket a folded paper
and handed it to Gabriel. He received it mechanically,
and opened it. It was his wife's note of the preceding
night. He took out his knife, still holding the letter, and
with its blade began stirring the bowl of his pipe. Then
after a pause, he asked cautiously&mdash;</p>

<p>"And how did <i>ye</i> come by this yer?"</p>

<p>"It was found by Sal Clark, brought to Mrs. Markle,
and given to me. Its existence is known only to three
people, and they are your friends."</p>

<p>There was another pause, in which Gabriel deliberately
stirred the contents of his pipe. Mr. Maxwell examined
him curiously.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, at last, "what is your defence?"</p>

<p>Gabriel sat up on the bed and rapped the bowl of his pipe
against the bedpost to loosen some refractory encrustation.</p>

<p>"Wot," he asked, gravely, "would be <i>your</i> idee of a
good defence? Axin ye ez a lawyer having experin's in
them things, and reck'nin' to pay ez high ez eny man fo' the
same, wot would <i>you</i> call a good defence?" And he
gravely laid himself down again in an attitude of respectful
attention.</p>

<p>"We hope to prove," said Maxwell, really smiling, "that
when you left your house and came to my office the murdered
man was alive and at his hotel; that he went over to
the hill long before you did; that <i>you</i> did not return until
the evening&mdash;<i>after</i> the murder was committed, as the 'secret'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
mentioned in your wife's mysterious note evidently shows.
That for some reason or other it was her design to place
you in a suspicious attitude. That the note shows that she
refers to some fact of which she was cognisant and not
yourself."</p>

<p>"Suthin' that she knowed, and I didn't get to hear,"
translated Gabriel, quietly.</p>

<p>"Exactly! Now you see the importance of that note."</p>

<p>Gabriel did not immediately reply, but slowly lifted his
huge frame from the bed, walked to the open window, still
holding the paper in his hands, deliberately tore it into the
minutest shreds before the lawyer could interfere, and then
threw it from the window.</p>

<p>"Thet paper don't 'mount ter beans, no how!" he said,
quietly but explanatively as he returned to the bed.</p>

<p>It was Lawyer Maxwell's turn to become dumb. In his
astonished abstraction he forgot to wipe his mouth, and
gazed at Gabriel with his nervous smile as if his client had
just perpetrated a practical joke of the first magnitude.</p>

<p>"Ef it's the same to you, I'll just gin ye me idee of a
de-fence," said Gabriel, apologetically, relighting his pipe,
"allowin' o' course that you knows best, and askin' no
deduckshun from your charges for advice. Well, you jess
stands up afore the jedge, and you slings 'em a yarn suthin'
like this: 'Yer's me, for instans,' you sez, sez you, 'ez
gambols&mdash;gambols very deep&mdash;jess fights the tiger, wharever
and whenever found, the same bein' onbeknownst ter folks
gin'rally, and spechil te my wife, ez was July. Yer's me
been gambolin' desprit with this yer man, Victyor Ramyirez,
and gets lifted bad! and we hez, so to speak, a differculty
about some pints in the game. I allows one thing, he allows
another, and this yer man gives me the lie and I stabs him!'
Stop&mdash;hole your hosses!" interjected Gabriel, suddenly,
"thet looks bad, don't it? he bein' a small man, a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
feller 'bout your size. No! Well, this yer's the way we
puts it up: 'Seving men&mdash;<i>seving</i>&mdash;friends o' his, comes at
me, permiskis like, one down, and nex' comes on, and we
hez it mighty lively thar fur an hour, until me, bein' in a
tight place, hez to use a knife and cuts this yer man bad!'
Thar, that's 'bout the thing! Now ez to my runnin' away,
you sez, sez you, ez how I disremembers owin' to the
'citement that I hez a 'pintent in Sacramento the very
nex' day, and waltzes down yer to keep it, in a hurry. Ef
they want to know whar July ez, you sez she gits wild on
my not comin' home, and starts that very night arter me.
Thar, thet's 'bout my idee&mdash;puttin' it o' course in your own
shape, and slingin' in them bits o' po'try and garbage, and
kinder sassin' the plaintiff's counsel, ez you know goes down
afore a jedge and jury."</p>

<p>Maxwell rose hopelessly,&mdash;"Then, if I understand you,
you intend to admit"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thet I done it? In course!" replied Gabriel; "but,"
he added, with a cunning twinkle in his eye, "justifybly&mdash;justifyble
homyside, ye mind!&mdash;bein' in fear o' my life from
seving men. In course," he added, hurriedly, "I can't
identify them seving strangers in the dark, so thar's no harm
or suspicion goin' to be done enny o' the boys in the Gulch."</p>

<p>Maxwell walked gravely to the window, and stood looking
out without speaking. Suddenly he turned upon Gabriel
with a brighter face and more earnest manner. "Where's
Olly?"</p>

<p>Gabriel's face fell. He hesitated a moment. "I was on
my way to the school in Sacramento whar she iz."</p>

<p>"You must send for her&mdash;I must see her at once!"</p>

<p>Gabriel laid his powerful hand on the lawyer's shoulder.
"She izn't&mdash;that chile&mdash;to knows anythin' o' this. You
hear?" he said, in a voice that began in tones of deprecation,
and ended in a note of stern warning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p>"How are you to keep it from her?" said Maxwell, as
determinedly. "In less than twenty-four hours every newspaper
in the state will have it&mdash;with their own version and
comments. No; you must see her. She must hear it first
from your own lips."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;I&mdash;can't&mdash;see&mdash;her just now," said Gabriel, with
a voice that for the first time during their interview faltered
in its accents.</p>

<p>"Nor need you," responded the lawyer, quickly. "Trust
that to me. <i>I</i> will see her, and you shall afterwards. You
need not fear I will prejudice your case. Give me the
address! Quick!" he added, as the sound of footsteps
and voices approaching the room, came from the hall.
Gabriel did as he requested. "Now one word," he continued
hurriedly, as the footsteps halted at the door.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Gabriel.</p>

<p>"As you value your life and Olly's happiness, hold your
tongue."</p>

<p>Gabriel nodded with cunning comprehension. The door
opened to Mr. Jack Hamlin, diabolically mischievous, self-confident
and audacious! With a familiar nod to Maxwell
he stepped quickly before Gabriel and extended his hand.
Simply, yet conscious of obeying some vague magnetic influence,
Gabriel reached out his own hand and took Jack's
white, nervous fingers in his own calm, massive grasp.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you, pard!" said that gentleman, showing
his white teeth and reaching up to clap his disengaged
hand on Gabriel's shoulder. "Glad to see you, old boy,&mdash;even
if you have cut in and taken a job out of my hands
that I was rather lyin' by to do myself. Sooner or later
I'd have fetched that Mexican&mdash;if you hadn't dropped into
my seat and taken up my hand. Oh, it's all right, Mack!"
he said, intercepting the quick look of caution that Maxwell
darted at his client, "don't do that. We're all friends here.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
If you want me to testify, I'll take my oath that there
hasn't been a day this six months that that infernal hound,
Ramirez, wasn't jest pantin' to be planted in his tracks!
I can hardly believe I ain't done it myself." He stopped,
partly to enjoy the palpable uneasiness of Maxwell, and
perhaps in some admiration of Gabriel's physique.</p>

<p>Maxwell quickly seized this point of vantage. "You
can do your friend here a very great service," he said to
Jack, lowering his voice as he spoke.</p>

<p>Jack laughed. "No, Mack, it won't do! They wouldn't
believe me! There ain't judge or jury you could play that
on!"</p>

<p>"You don't understand me," said Maxwell, laughing a
little awkwardly. "I didn't mean that, Jack. This man
was going to Sacramento to see his little sister"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go on," said Jack, with much gravity; "of course he
was. I know that. 'Dear brother, dear brother, come
home with me now!' Certainly. So'm I. Goin' to see
an innocent little thing 'bout seventeen years old, blue
eyes and curly hair! Always go there once a week. Says
he must come! Says she'll"&mdash;&mdash;he stopped in the full
tide of his irony, for, looking up, he caught a glimpse of
Gabriel's simple, troubled face and sadly reproachful eyes.
"Look here," said Jack, turning savagely on Maxwell,
"what are you talking about anyway?"</p>

<p>"I mean what I say," returned Maxwell, quickly. "He
was going to see his sister&mdash;a mere child. Of course he
can't go now. But he must see her&mdash;if she can be brought
to him. Can you&mdash;<i>will</i> you do it?"</p>

<p>Jack cast another swift glance at Gabriel. "Count me
in," he said, promptly; "when shall I go?"</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;at once."</p>

<p>"All right. Where shall I fetch her to?"</p>

<p>"One Horse Gulch."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>

<p>"The game's made," said Jack, sententiously. "She'll
be there by sundown to-morrow." He was off like a flash,
but as swiftly returned, and called Maxwell to the door.
"Look here," he said, in a whisper, "p'r'aps it would be
as well if the sheriff didn't know I was <i>his</i> friend," he went
on, indicating Gabriel with a toss of his head and a wink
of his black eye, "because, you see, Joe Hall and I ain't
friends. We had a little difficulty, and some shootin' and
foolishness down at Marysville last year. Joe's a good,
square man, but he ain't above prejudice, and it might go
against our man."</p>

<p>Maxwell nodded, and Jack once more darted off.</p>

<p>But his colour was so high, and his exaltation so excessive,
that when he reached his room his faithful Pete looked
at him in undisguised alarm. "Bress us&mdash;it tain't no
whisky, Mars Jack, arter all de doctors tole you?" he said,
clasping his hands in dismay.</p>

<p>The bare suggestion was enough for Jack in his present
hilarious humour. He instantly hiccuped, lapsed wildly
over against Pete with artfully simulated alcoholic weakness,
tumbled him on the floor, and grasping his white,
woolly head, waved over it a boot-jack, and frantically
demanded "another bottle." Then he laughed; as suddenly
got up with the greatest gravity and a complete change in
his demeanour, and wanted to know, severely, what he,
Pete, meant by lying there on the floor in a state of beastly
intoxication?</p>

<p>"Bress me! Mars Jack, but ye <i>did</i> frighten me. I jiss
allowed dem tourists downstairs had been gettin' ye tight."</p>

<p>"You did&mdash;you degraded old ruffian! If you'd been
reading Volney's 'Ruins,' or reflectin' on some of those
moral maxims that I'm just wastin' my time and health
unloading to you, instead of making me the subject of
your inebriated reveries, you wouldn't get picked up so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
often. Pack my valise, and chuck it into some horse and
buggy&mdash;no matter whose. Be quick."</p>

<p>"Is we gwine to Sacramento, Mars Jack?"</p>

<p>"<i>We?</i> No, sir. <i>I'm</i> going&mdash;alone! What I'm doing
now, sir, is only the result or calm reflection&mdash;of lying
awake nights taking points and jest spottin' the whole
situation. And I'm convinced, Peter, that I can stay with
you no longer. You've been hackin' the keen edge of my
finer feelin's; playin' it very low down on my moral and
religious nature, generally ringin' in a cold deck on my
spiritual condition for the last five years. You've jest cut
up thet rough with my higher emotions thet there ain't
enough left to chip in on a ten-cent ante. Five years
ago," continued Jack, coolly, brushing his curls before the
glass, "I fell into your hands a guileless, simple youth, in
the first flush of manhood, knowin' no points, easily picked
up on my sensibilities, and travellin', so to speak, on my
shape! And where am I now? Echo answers 'where?'
and passes for a euchre! No, Peter, I leave you to-night.
Wretched misleader of youth, gummy old man with the
strawberry eyebrows, farewell!"</p>

<p>Evidently this style of exordium was no novelty to Pete,
for without apparently paying the least attention to it, he
went on surlily packing his master's valise. When he had
finished he looked up at Mr. Hamlin, who was humming,
in a heart-broken way, "<i>Yes, we must part</i>," varied by
occasional glances of exaggerated reproach at Pete, and
said, as he shouldered the valise&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dis yer ain't no woman foolishness, Mars Jack, like
down at dat yar Mission?"</p>

<p>"Your suggestion, Peter," returned Jack, with dignity,
"emanates from a moral sentiment debased by Love
Feasts and Camp Meetings, and an intellect weakened by
Rum and Gum and the contact of Lager Beer Jerkers. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
is worthy of a short-card sharp and a keno flopper, which I
have, I regret to say, long suspected you to be. Farewell!
You will stay here until I come back. If I don't come
back by the day after to-morrow, come to One Horse
Gulch. Pay the bill, and don't knock down for yourself
more than seventy-five per cent. Remember I am getting
old and feeble. You are yet young, with a brilliant future
before you. Git."</p>

<p>He tossed a handful of gold on the bed, adjusted his
hat carefully over his curls, and strode from the room.
In the lower hall he stopped long enough to take aside
Mr. Raynor, and with an appearance of the greatest conscientiousness,
to correct an error of two feet in the
measurements he had given him that morning of an enormous
pine tree in whose prostrate trunk he, Mr. Hamlin,
had once found a peaceful, happy tribe of one hundred
Indians living. Then lifting his hat with marked politeness
to Mrs. Raynor, and totally ignoring the presence of
Mr. Raynor's mentor and companion, he leaped lightly
into the buggy and drove away.</p>

<p>"An entertaining fellow," said Mr. Raynor, glancing
after the cloud of dust that flew from the untarrying wheels
of Mr. Hamlin's chariot.</p>

<p>"And so gentlemanly," smiled Mrs. Raynor.</p>

<p>But the journalistic conservator of the public morals of
California, in and for the city and county of San Francisco,
looked grave, and deprecated even that feeble praise of the
departed. "His class are a curse to the country. They
hold the law in contempt; they retard by the example of
their extravagance the virtues of economy and thrift; they
are consumers and not producers; they bring the fair fame
of this land into question by those who foolishly take them
for a type of the people."</p>

<p>"But, dear me," said Mrs. Raynor, pouting, "where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
your gamblers and bad men are so fascinating, and your
honest miners are so dreadfully murderous, and kill people,
and then sit down to breakfast with you as if nothing had
happened, what are you going to do?"</p>

<p>The journalist did not immediately reply. In the course
of some eloquent remarks, as unexceptionable in morality
as in diction, which I regret I have not space to reproduce
here, he, however, intimated that there was still an Unfettered
Press, which "scintillated" and "shone" and
"lashed" and "stung" and "exposed" and "tore away
the veil," and became at various times a Palladium and a
Watchtower, and did and was a great many other remarkable
things peculiar to an Unfettered Press in a pioneer
community, when untrammelled by the enervating conditions
of an effete civilisation.</p>

<p>"And what have they done with the murderer?" asked
Mr. Raynor, repressing a slight yawn.</p>

<p>"Taken him back to One Horse Gulch half an hour
ago. I reckon he'd as lief stayed here," said a bystander.
"From the way things are pintin', it looks as if it might be
putty lively for him up thar!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Raynor, curiously.</p>

<p>"Well, two or three of them old Vigilantes from Angel's
passed yer a minit ago with their rifles, goin' up that way,"
returned the man, lazily. "Mayn't be nothing in it, but
it looks mighty like"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Like what?" asked Mr. Raynor, a little nervously.</p>

<p>"Lynchin'!" said the man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>

<h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

<h5>IN WHICH MR. DUMPHY TAKES POINSETT INTO HIS
CONFIDENCE.</h5>


<p>The cool weather of the morning following Mr. Dumphy's
momentous interview with Colonel Starbottle, contributed
somewhat to restore the former gentleman's tranquillity,
which had been considerably disturbed. He had, moreover,
a vague recollection of having invited Colonel Starbottle
to visit him socially, and a nervous dread of meeting this
man, whose audacity was equal to his own, in the company
of others. Braced, however, by the tonic of the clear
exhilarating air, and sustained by the presence of his
clerks and the respectful homage of his business associates,
he despatched a note to Arthur Poinsett requesting an
interview. Punctually at the hour named that gentleman
presented himself, and was languidly surprised when
Mr. Dumphy called his clerk and gave positive orders
that their interview was not to be disturbed and to refuse
admittance to all other visitors. And then Mr. Dumphy,
in a peremptory, practical statement which his business
habits and temperament had brought to a perfection that
Arthur could not help admiring, presented the details of
his interview with Colonel Starbottle. "Now, I want you
to help me. I have sent to you for that business purpose.
You understand, this is not a matter for the Bank's regular
counsel. Now what do you propose?"</p>

<p>"First, let me ask you, do you believe your wife is
living?"</p>

<p>"No," said Dumphy, promptly, "but of course I don't
know."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then let me relieve your mind at once, and tell you
that she is not."</p>

<p>"You know this to be a fact?" asked Dumphy.</p>

<p>"I do. The body supposed to be Grace Conroy's and
so identified, was your wife's. I recognised it at once,
knowing Grace Conroy to have been absent at the culmination
of the tragedy."</p>

<p>"And why did you not correct the mistake?"</p>

<p>"That is <i>my</i> business," said Arthur, haughtily, "and I
believe I have been invited here to attend to <i>yours</i>. Your
wife is dead."</p>

<p>"Then," said Mr. Dumphy, rising with a brisk business
air, "if you are willing to testify to that fact, I reckon
there is nothing more to be done."</p>

<p>Arthur did not rise, but sat watching Mr. Dumphy with
an unmoved face. After a moment Mr. Dumphy sat down
again, and looked aggressively but nervously at Arthur.
"Well," he said, at last.</p>

<p>"Is that all?" asked Arthur, quietly; "are you willing
to go on and establish the fact?"</p>

<p>"Don't know what you mean!" said Dumphy, with an
attempted frankness which failed signally.</p>

<p>"One moment, Mr. Dumphy. You are a shrewd business
man. Now do you suppose the person&mdash;whoever he
or she may be, who has sent Colonel Starbottle to you,
relies alone upon your inability to legally prove your wife's
death? May they not calculate somewhat on your <i>indisposition</i>
to prove it legally; on the theory that you'd rather
not open the case, for instance?"</p>

<p>Mr. Dumphy hesitated a moment and bit his lip. "Of
course," he said, shortly, "there'd be some talk among my
enemies about my deserting my wife"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"And child," suggested Arthur.</p>

<p>"And child," repeated Dumphy, savagely, "and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
coming back again&mdash;there'd be suthin' in the papers about
it, unless I paid 'em, but what's that!&mdash;deserting one's wife
isn't such a new thing in California."</p>

<p>"That is so," said Arthur, with a sarcasm that was none
the less sincere because he felt its applicability to himself.</p>

<p>"But we're not getting on," said Mr. Dumphy, impatiently.
"What's to be done? That's what I've sent
to you for."</p>

<p>"Now that we know it is not your <i>wife</i>&mdash;we must find out
<i>who</i> it is that stands back of Colonel Starbottle. It is
evidently some one who knows, at least, as much as we do
of the facts; we are lucky if they know no more. Can you
think of any one? Who are the survivors? Let's see; you,
myself, possibly Grace"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"It couldn't be Grace Conroy, really alive!" interrupted
Dumphy hastily.</p>

<p>"No," said Arthur, quietly, "you remember <i>she</i> was not
present at the time."</p>

<p>"Gabriel?"</p>

<p>"I hardly think so. Besides, he is a friend of yours."</p>

<p>"It couldn't be"&mdash;Dumphy stopped in his speech, with
a certain savage alarm in his looks. Arthur noticed it&mdash;and
quietly went on.</p>

<p>"Who 'couldn't' it be?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;nobody. I was only thinking if Gabriel or
somebody could have told the story to some designing
rascal."</p>

<p>"Hardly&mdash;in sufficient detail."</p>

<p>"Well," said Dumphy, with his coarse bark-like laugh,
"if I've got to pay to see Mrs. Dumphy decently buried, I
suppose I can rely upon you to see that it's done without a
chance of resurrection. Find out who Starbottle's friend is
and how much he or she expects. If I've got to pay for this
thing I'll do it now, and get the benefit of absolute silence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
So I'll leave it in your hands," and he again rose as if dismissing
the subject and his visitor, after his habitual business
manner.</p>

<p>"Dumphy," said Arthur, still keeping his own seat, and
ignoring the significance of Dumphy's manner. "There
are two professions that suffer from a want of frankness in
the men who seek their services. Those professions are
Medicine and the Law. I can understand why a man seeks
to deceive his physician, because he is humbugging himself;
but I can't see why he is not frank to his lawyer!
You are no exception to the rule. You are now concealing
from <i>me</i>, whose aid you have sought, some very important
reason why you wish to have this whole affair hidden beneath
the snow of Starvation Camp."</p>

<p>"Don't know what you're driving at," said Dumphy.
But he sat down again.</p>

<p>"Well, listen to me, and perhaps I can make my meaning
clearer. My acquaintance with the late Dr. Devarges
began some months before we saw you. During our intimacy
he often spoke to me of his scientific discoveries, in which
I took some interest, and I remember seeing among his
papers frequent records and descriptions of localities in the
foot-hills, which he thought bore the indications of great
mineral wealth. At that time the Doctor's theories and
speculations appeared to me to be visionary, and the records
of no value. Nevertheless, when we were shut up in Starvation
Camp, and it seemed doubtful if the Doctor would
survive his discoveries, at his request I deposited his papers
and specimens in a cairn at Monument Point. After the
catastrophe, on my return with the relief party to camp, we
found that the cairn had been opened by some one and the
papers and specimens scattered on the snow. We supposed
this to have been the work of Mrs. Brackett, who, in search
of food, had broken the cairn, taken out the specimens, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
died from the effects of the poison with which they had
been preserved."</p>

<p>He paused and looked at Dumphy, who did not speak.</p>

<p>"Now," continued Arthur, "like all Californians I have
followed your various successes with interest and wonder.
I have noticed, with the gratification that all your friends
experience, the singular good fortune which has distinguished
your mining enterprises, and the claims you have
located. But I have been cognisant of a fact, unknown I
think to any other of your friends, that nearly all of the
localities of your successful claims, by a singular coincidence,
agree with the memorandums of Dr. Devarges!"</p>

<p>Dumphy sprang to his feet with a savage, brutal laugh.
"So," he shouted, coarsely, "that's the game, is it! So it
seems I'm lucky in coming to you&mdash;no trouble in finding
this <i>woman</i> now, hey? Well, go on, this is getting interesting;
let's hear the rest! What are your propositions, what
if I refuse, hey?"</p>

<p>"My first proposition," said Arthur, rising to his feet with
a cold wicked light in his grey eyes, "is that you shall instantly
take that speech back and beg my pardon! If you
refuse, by the living God, I'll throttle you where you
stand!"</p>

<p>For one wild moment all the savage animal in Dumphy
rose, and he instinctively made a step in the direction of
Poinsett. Arthur did not move. Then Mr. Dumphy's
practical caution asserted itself. A physical personal
struggle with Arthur would bring in witnesses&mdash;witnesses
perhaps of something more than that personal struggle. If
he were victorious, Arthur, unless killed outright, would
revenge himself by an exposure. He sank back in his
chair again. Had Arthur known the low estimate placed
upon his honour by Mr. Dumphy he would have been less
complacent in his victory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></p>

<p>"I didn't mean to suspect <i>you</i>," said Dumphy at last,
with a forced smile, "I hope you'll excuse me. I know
you're my friend. But you're all wrong about these
papers; you are, Poinsett, I swear. I know if the fact
were known to outsiders it would look queer if not
explained. But whose business is it, anyway, legally, I
mean?"</p>

<p>"No one's, unless Devarges has friends or heirs."</p>

<p>"He hadn't any."</p>

<p>"There's that wife!"</p>

<p>"Bah!&mdash;she was divorced!"</p>

<p>"Indeed! You told me on our last interview that she
really was the widow of Devarges."</p>

<p>"Never mind that now," said Dumphy, impatiently.
"Look here! You know as well as I do that no matter
how many discoveries Devarges made, they weren't worth
a d&mdash;n if he hadn't done some work on them&mdash;improved
or opened them."</p>

<p>"But that is not the point at issue just now," said
Arthur. "Nobody is going to contest your claim or sue
you for damages. But they might try to convict you of a
crime. They might say that breaking into the cairn was
burglary, and the taking of the papers theft."</p>

<p>"But how are they going to prove that?"</p>

<p>"No matter. Listen to me, and don't let us drift away
from the main point. The question that concerns you is
this. An impostor sets up a claim to be your wife; you
and I know she is an impostor, and can prove it. She
knows that, but knows also that in attempting to prove it
you lay yourself open to some grave charges which she
doubtless stands ready to make."</p>

<p>"Well, then, the first thing to do is to find out <i>who</i> she
is, what she knows, and what she wants, eh?" said
Dumphy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," said Arthur, quietly, "the first thing to do is to
prove that your wife is really dead, and to do that you
must show that Grace Conroy was alive when the body
purporting to be hers, but which was really your wife's,
was discovered. Once establish <i>that</i> fact and you destroy
the credibility of the Spanish reports, and you need not
fear any revelation from that source regarding the missing
papers. And that is the only source from which evidence
against you can be procured. But when you destroy the
validity of that report, you of course destroy the credibility
of all concerned in making it. And as I was concerned in
making it, of course it won't do for you to put <i>me</i> on the
stand."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Dumphy's disappointment, he could not
help yielding to a sudden respect for the superior rascal
who thus cleverly slipped out of responsibility. "But,"
added Arthur, coolly, "you'll have no difficulty in establishing
the fact of Grace's survival by others."</p>

<p>Dumphy thought at once of Ramirez. Here was a man
who had seen and conversed with Grace when she had, in
the face of the Spanish Commander, indignantly asserted
her identity and the falsity of the report. No witness
could be more satisfactory and convincing. But to make
use of him he must first take Arthur into his confidence;
must first expose the conspiracy of Madame Devarges to
personate Grace, and his own complicity with the transaction.
He hesitated. Nevertheless, he had been lately
tortured by a suspicion that the late Madame Devarges
was in some way connected with the later conspiracy
against himself, and he longed to avail himself of Arthur's
superior sagacity, and after a second reflection he concluded
to do it. With the same practical conciseness of
statement that he had used in relating Colonel Starbottle's
interview with himself, he told the story of Madame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
Devarges' brief personation of Grace Conroy, and its
speedy and felicitous ending in Mrs. Conroy. Arthur
listened with unmistakable interest and a slowly brightening
colour. When Dumphy had concluded he sat for a
moment apparently lost in thought.</p>

<p>"Well?" at last said Dumphy, interrogatively and
impatiently.</p>

<p>Arthur started. "Well," he said, rising, and replacing
his hat with the air of a man who had thoroughly exhausted
his subject, "your frankness has saved me a world of
trouble."</p>

<p>"How?" said Dumphy.</p>

<p>"There is no necessity for looking any further for your
alleged wife. She exists at present as Mrs. Conroy, <i>alias</i>
Madame Devarges, <i>alias</i> Grace Conroy. Ramirez is your
witness. You couldn't have a more willing one."</p>

<p>"Then my suspicions are correct."</p>

<p>"I don't know on what you based them. But here is a
woman who has unlimited power over men, particularly
over one man, Gabriel!&mdash;who alone, of all men but ourselves,
knows the facts regarding your desertion of your
wife in Starvation Camp, her death, and the placing of Dr.
Devarges' private papers by me in the cairn. He knows,
too, of your knowledge of the existence of the cairn, its
locality, and contents. He knows this because he was in
the cabin that night when the Doctor gave me his dying
injunctions regarding his property&mdash;the night that you&mdash;excuse
me, Dumphy, but nothing but frankness will save
us now&mdash;the night that you stood listening at the door and
frightened Grace with your wolfish face. Don't speak!
she told me all about it! Your presence there that night
gained you the information that you have used so profitably;
it was your presence that fixed her wavering resolves and
sent her away with me."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></p>

<p>Both men had become very pale and earnest. Arthur
moved toward the door. "I will see you to-morrow, when
I will have matured some plan of defence," he said,
abstractedly. "We have"&mdash;he used the plural of advocacy
with a peculiar significance&mdash;"<i>We</i> have a clever woman
to fight who may be more than our match. Meantime,
remember that Ramirez is our defence; he is our man,
Dumphy, hold fast to him as you would to your life.
Good-day."</p>

<p>In another moment he was gone. As the door closed
upon him a clerk entered hastily from the outer office.
"You said not to disturb you, sir, and here is an important
despatch waiting for you from Wingdam."</p>

<p>Mr. Dumphy took it mechanically, opened it, read the
first line, and then said hurriedly, "Run after that man,
quick!&mdash;Stop! Wait a moment. You need not go! There,
that will do!"</p>

<p>The clerk hurriedly withdrew into the outer office. Mr.
Dumphy went back to his desk again, and once more
devoured the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Wingdam</span>, 7th, 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>&mdash;Victor Ramirez murdered last night on
Conroy's Hill. Gabriel Conroy arrested. Mrs. Conroy missing. Great
excitement here; strong feeling against Gabriel. Wait instructions.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Fitch.</span>"</p></blockquote>

<p>At first Mr. Dumphy only heard as an echo beating in
his brain, the parting words of Arthur Poinsett, "Ramirez
is our defence; hold fast to him as you would your life."
And now he was dead&mdash;gone; their only witness; killed
by Gabriel the plotter! What more was wanted to justify
his worst suspicions? What should they do? He must
send after Poinsett again; the plan of defence must be
changed at once; to-morrow might be too late. Stop!</p>

<p>One of his accusers in prison charged with a capital
crime! The other&mdash;the real murderer&mdash;for Dumphy made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
no doubt that Mrs. Conroy was responsible for the deed&mdash;a
fugitive from justice! What need of any witness now?
The blow that crippled these three conspirators had liberated
him! For a moment Mr. Dumphy was actually conscious
of a paroxysm of gratitude toward some indefinitely Supreme
Being&mdash;a God of special providence&mdash;special to himself!
More than this, there was that vague sentiment, common,
I fear, to common humanity in such crises, that this Providence
was a tacit endorsement of himself. It was the
triumph of Virtue (Dumphy) over Vice (Conroy <i>et al.</i>).</p>

<p>But there would be a trial, publicity, and the possible
exposure of certain things by a man whom danger might
make reckless. And could he count upon Mrs. Conroy's
absence or neutrality? He was conscious that her feeling
for her husband was stronger than he had supposed, and
she might dare everything to save him. What had a woman
of that kind to do with such weakness? Why hadn't she
managed it so as to kill Gabriel too? There was an evident
want of practical completeness in this special Providence
that, as a business man, Mr. Dumphy felt he could have
regulated. And then he was seized with an idea&mdash;a
damnable inspiration!&mdash;and set himself briskly to write.
I regret to say that despite the popular belief in the
dramatic character of all villany, Mr. Dumphy at this
moment presented only the commonplace spectacle of an
absorbed man of business; no lurid light gleamed from
his pale blue eyes; no Satanic smile played around the
corners of his smoothly shaven mouth; no feverish exclamation
stirred his moist, cool lips. He wrote methodically
and briskly, without deliberation or undue haste. When
he had written half-a-dozen letters he folded and sealed
them, and without summoning his clerk, took them himself
into the outer office and thence into the large counting-room.
The news of the murder had evidently got abroad;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
the clerks were congregated together, and the sound of
eager, interested voices ceased as the great man entered
and stood among them.</p>

<p>"Fitch, you and Judson will take the quickest route to
One Horse Gulch to-night. Don't waste any time on the
road or spare any expense. When you get there deliver
these letters, and take your orders from my correspondents.
Pick up all the details you can about this affair and let me
know. What's your balance at the Gulch, Mr. Peebles?
never mind the exact figures!"</p>

<p>"Larger than usual, sir, some heavy deposits!"</p>

<p>"Increase your balance then if there should be any d&mdash;d
fools who connect the Bank with this matter."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Mr. Fitch, respectfully, "we're to look
after your foreman, Mr. Conroy, sir?"</p>

<p>"You are to take your orders from my correspondent,
Mr. Fitch, and not to interfere in any way with public sentiment.
We have nothing to do with the private acts of
anybody. Justice will probably be done to Conroy. It is
time that these outrages upon the reputation of the California
miner should be stopped. When the fame of a whole community
is prejudiced and business injured by the rowdyism
of a single ruffian," said Mr. Dumphy, raising his voice
slightly as he discovered the interested and absorbed presence
of some of his most respectable customers, "it is
time that prompt action should be taken." In fact, he
would have left behind him a strong Roman flavour and a
general suggestion of Brutus, had he not unfortunately
effected an anti-climax by adding, "that's business, sir," as
he retired to his private office.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>

<h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>

<h5>MR. HAMLIN IS OFF WITH AN OLD LOVE.</h5>


<p>Mr. Jack Hamlin did not lose much time on the road
from Wingdam to Sacramento. His rapid driving, his dust
bespattered vehicle, and the exhausted condition of his
horse on arrival, excited but little comment from those who
knew his habits, and for other criticism he had a supreme
indifference. He was prudent enough, however, to leave
his horse at a stable on the outskirts, and having reconstructed
his toilet at a neighbouring hotel, he walked briskly
toward the address given him by Maxwell. When he reached
the corner of the street and was within a few paces of the
massive shining door plate of Madame Eclair's <i>Pensionnat</i>,
he stopped with a sudden ejaculation, and after a moment's
hesitation, turned on his heel deliberately and began to
retrace his steps.</p>

<p>To explain Mr. Hamlin's singular conduct I shall be
obliged to disclose a secret of his, which I would fain keep
from the fair reader. On receiving Olly's address from
Maxwell, Mr. Hamlin had only cursorily glanced at it, and
it was only on arriving before the house that he recognised
to his horror that it was a boarding-school, with one of
whose impulsive inmates he had whiled away his idleness a
few months before in a heart-breaking but innocent flirtation,
and a soul-subduing but clandestine correspondence,
much to the distaste of the correct Principal. To have
presented himself there in his proper person would be to
have been refused admittance or subjected to a suspicion
that would have kept Olly from his hands. For once, Mr.
Hamlin severely regretted his infelix reputation among the
sex. But he did not turn his back on his enterprise. He
retraced his steps only to the main street, visited a barber's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
shop and a jeweller's, and reappeared on the street again
with a pair of enormous green goggles and all traces of his
long distinguishing silken black moustache shaven from his
lip. When it is remembered that this rascal was somewhat
vain of his personal appearance, the reader will appreciate
his earnestness and the extent of his sacrifice.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he was a little nervous as he was ushered
into the formal reception-room of the <i>Pensionnat</i>, and
waited until his credentials, countersigned by Maxwell, were
submitted to Madame Eclair. Mr. Hamlin had no fear of
being detected by his real name; in the brief halcyon days
of his romance he had been known as Clarence Spifflington,&mdash;an
ingenious combination of the sentimental and humorous
which suited his fancy, and to some extent he felt expressed
the character of his affection. Fate was propitious; the
servant returned saying that Miss Conroy would be down
in a moment, and Mr. Hamlin looked at his watch. Every
moment was precious; he was beginning to get impatient
when the door opened again and Olly slipped into the room.</p>

<p>She was a pretty child, with a peculiar boyish frankness
of glance and manner, and a refinement of feature that
fascinated Mr. Hamlin, who, fond as he was of all childhood,
had certain masculine preferences for good looks.
She seemed to be struggling with a desire to laugh when
she entered, and when Jack turned towards her with
extended hands she held up her own warningly, and
closing the door behind her cautiously, said, in a demure
whisper&mdash;</p>

<p>"She'll come down as soon as she can slip past
Madame's door."</p>

<p>"Who?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"Sophy."</p>

<p>"Who's Sophy?" asked Jack, seriously. He had never
known the name of his Dulcinea. In the dim epistolatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
region of sentiment she had existed only as "The Blue
Moselle," so called from the cerulean hue of her favourite
raiment, and occasionally, in moments of familiar endearment,
as "Mosey."</p>

<p>"Come, now, pretend you don't know, will you?" said
Olly, evading the kiss which Jack always had ready for
childhood. "If I was her, I wouldn't have anything to
say to you after that!" she added, with that ostentatious
chivalry of the sex towards each other, in the presence of
their common enemy. "Why, she saw you from the
window when you first came this morning, when you went
back again and shaved off your moustache; she knew you.
And you don't know her! It's mean, ain't it?&mdash;they'll
grow again, won't they?"&mdash;Miss Olly referred to the
mustachios and not the affections!</p>

<p>Jack was astonished and alarmed. In his anxiety to
evade or placate the duenna, he had never thought of her
charge&mdash;his sweetheart. Here was a dilemma! "Oh
yes!" said Jack hastily, with a well simulated expression
of arch affection, "Sophy&mdash;of course&mdash;that's my little
game! But I've got a note for you too, my dear," and he
handed Olly the few lines that Gabriel had hastily scrawled.
He watched her keenly, almost breathlessly, as she read them.
To his utter bewilderment she laid the note down indifferently
and said, "That's like Gabe&mdash;the old simpleton!"</p>

<p>"But you're goin' to do what he says," asked Mr.
Hamlin, "ain't you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Olly, promptly, "I ain't! Why, Lord!
Mr. Hamlin, you don't know that man; why, he does this
sort o' thing every week!" Perceiving Jack stare, she
went on, "Why, only last week, didn't he send to me to
meet him out on the corner of the street, and he my own
brother, instead o' comin' here, ez he hez a right to do.
Go to him at Wingdam? No! ketch me!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>

<p>"But suppose he can't come," continued Mr. Hamlin.</p>

<p>"Why can't he come? I tell you, it's just foolishness
and the meanest kind o' bashfulness. Jes because there
happened to be a young lady here from San Francisco,
Rosey Ringround, who was a little took with the old fool.
If he could come to Wingdam, why couldn't he come
here,&mdash;that's what I want to know?"</p>

<p>"Will you let me see that note?" asked Hamlin.</p>

<p>Olly handed him the note, with the remark, "He don't
spell well&mdash;and he won't let me teach him&mdash;the old
Muggins!"</p>

<p>Hamlin took it and read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Olly</span>,&mdash;If it don't run a fowl uv yer lessings and the
Maddam's willin' and the young laddies, Brother Gab's waitin' fer ye
at Wingdam, so no more from your affeshtunate brother, <span class="smcap">Gab</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Hamlin was in a quandary. It never had been part
of his plan to let Olly know the importance of her journey.
Mr. Maxwell's injunctions to bring her "quietly," his own
fears of an outburst that might bring a questioning and
sympathetic school about his ears, and lastly, and not the
least potently, his own desire to enjoy Olly's company in
the long ride to One Horse Gulch without the preoccupation
of grief, with his own comfortable conviction that he
could eventually bring Gabriel out of this "fix" without
Olly knowing anything about it, all this forbade his telling
her the truth. But here was a coil he had not thought of.
Howbeit, Mr. Hamlin was quick at expedients.</p>

<p>"Then you think Sophy can see me," he added, with a
sudden interest.</p>

<p>"Of course she will!" said Olly, archly. "It was right
smart in you to get acquainted with Gabe and set him up
to writing that, though it's just like him. He's that soft
that anybody could get round him. But there she is now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
Mr. Hamlin; that's her step on the stairs. And I don't
suppose you two hez any need of me now."</p>

<p>And she slipped out of the room, as demurely as she
had entered, at the same moment that a tall, slim, and
somewhat sensational young lady in blue came flying in.</p>

<p>I can, in justice to Mr. Hamlin, whose secrets have
been perhaps needlessly violated in the progress of this
story, do no less than pass over as sacred, and perhaps
wholly irrelevant to the issue, the interview that took
place between himself and Miss Sophy. That he succeeded
in convincing that young woman of his unaltered
loyalty, that he explained his long silence as the result of
a torturing doubt of the permanence of her own affection,
that his presence at that moment was the successful
culmination of a long-matured and desperate plan to see
her once more and learn the truth from her own lips, I
am sure that no member of my own disgraceful sex will
question, and I trust no member of a too fond and confiding
sex will doubt. That some bitterness was felt by
Mr. Hamlin, who was conscious of certain irregularities
during this long interval, and some tears shed by Miss
Sophy, who was equally conscious of more or less aberration
of her own magnetic instincts during his absence, I
think will be self-evident to the largely comprehending
reader. Howbeit, at the end of ten tender yet tranquillising
minutes Mr. Hamlin remarked, in low thrilling
tones&mdash;</p>

<p>"By the aid of a few confiding friends, and playin' it
rather low on them, I got that note to the Conroy girl, but
the game's up, and we might as well pass in our checks
now, if she goes back on us, and passes out, which I
reckon's her little game. If what you say is true, Sophy,
and you do sometimes look back to the past, and things is
generally on the square, you'll go for that Olly and fetch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
her, for if I go back without that child, and throw up my
hand, it's just tampering with the holiest affections and
playing it mighty rough on as white a man as ever you saw,
Sophy, to say nothing of your reputation, and everybody
ready to buck agin us who has ten cents to chip in on.
You must make her go back with me and put things on a
specie basis."</p>

<p>In spite of the mixed character of Mr. Hamlin's
metaphor, his eloquence was so convincing and effective
that Miss Sophy at once proceeded with considerable indignation
to insist upon Olly's withdrawing her refusal.</p>

<p>"If this is the way you are going to act, you horrid
little thing! after all that me and him's trusted you, I'd
like to see the girl in school that will ever tell <i>you</i> anything
again, that's all!" a threat so appalling that Olly, who did
not stop to consider that this confidence was very recent
and had been forced upon her, assented without further
delay, exhibited Gabriel's letter to Madame Eclair, and
having received that lady's gracious permission to visit her
brother, was in half an hour in company with Mr. Hamlin
on the road.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER V.</h4>

<h5>THE THREE VOICES.</h5>


<p>Once free from the trammelling fascinations of Sophy and
the more dangerous espionage of Madame Eclair, and with
the object of his mission accomplished, Mr. Hamlin
recovered his natural spirits, and became so hilarious that
Olly, who attributed this exaltation to his interview with
Sophy, felt constrained to make some disparaging remarks
about that young lady, partly by way of getting even with
her for her recent interference, and partly in obedience to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
some well known but unexplained law of the sex. To her
great surprise, however, Mr. Hamlin's spirits were in no
way damped, nor did he make any attempt to defend his
Lalage. Nevertheless, he listened attentively, and when
she had concluded he looked suddenly down upon her
chip hat and thick yellow tresses, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ever been in the Southern country, Olly?"</p>

<p>"No," returned the child.</p>

<p>"Never down about San Antonio, visiting friends or
relations?"</p>

<p>"No," said Olly, decidedly.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamlin was silent for some time, giving his exclusive
attention to his horse, who was evincing a disposition to
"break" into a gallop. When he had brought the animal
back into a trot again he continued&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>There's</i> a woman! Olly."</p>

<p>"Down in San Antonio?" asked Olly.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamlin nodded.</p>

<p>"Purty?" continued the child.</p>

<p>"It ain't the word," responded Mr. Hamlin, seriously.
"Purty ain't the word."</p>

<p>"As purty as Sophy?" continued Olly, a little mischievously.</p>

<p>"Sophy be hanged!" Mr. Hamlin here quickly pulled
up himself and horse, both being inclined to an exuberance
startling to the youth and sex of the third party. "That
is&mdash;I mean something in a different suit entirely."</p>

<p>Here he again hesitated, doubtful of his slang.</p>

<p>"I see," quoth Olly; "diamonds&mdash;Sophy's in spades."</p>

<p>The gambler (in sudden and awful admiration), "Diamonds&mdash;you've
just struck it! but what do <i>you</i> know 'bout
cards?"</p>

<p>Olly, <i>pomposaménte</i>, "Everything! Tell our fortunes by
'em&mdash;we girls! I'm in hearts&mdash;Sophy's in spades&mdash;you're<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
in clubs! Do you know," in a thrilling whisper, "only last
night I had a letter, a journey, a death, and a gentleman in
clubs, dark complected&mdash;that's you."</p>

<p>Mr. Hamlin&mdash;a good deal more at ease through this
revelation of the universal power of the four suits&mdash;"Speakin'
of women, I suppose down there (indicating the school)
you occasionally hear of angels. What's their general
complexion?"</p>

<p>Olly, dubiously, "In the pictures?"</p>

<p>Hamlin, "Yes;" with a leading question, "sorter dark
complected sometimes, hey?"</p>

<p>Olly, positively, "Never! always white."</p>

<p>Jack, "Always white?"</p>

<p>Olly, "Yes, and flabby!"</p>

<p>They rode along for some time silently. Presently Mr.
Hamlin broke into a song, a popular song, one verse of
which Olly supplied with such deftness of execution and
melodiousness of pipe that Mr. Hamlin instantly suggested
a duet, and so over the dead and barren wastes of the Sacramento
plains they fell to singing, often barbarously, sometimes
melodiously, but never self-consciously, wherein, I
take it, they approximated to the birds and better class of
poets, so that rough teamsters, rude packers, and weary
wayfarers were often touched, as with the birds and poets
aforesaid, to admiration and tenderness; and when they
stopped for supper at a wayside station, and Jack Hamlin
displayed that readiness of resource, audacity of manner
and address, and perfect and natural obliviousness to the
criticism of propriety or the limitations of precedent, and
when, moreover, the results of all this was a much better
supper than perhaps a more reputable companion could
have procured, she thought she had never known a more
engaging person than this Knave of Clubs.</p>

<p>When they were fairly on the road again, Olly began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
exhibit some curiosity regarding her brother, and asked
some few questions about Gabriel's family, which disclosed
the fact that Jack's acquaintance with Gabriel was comparatively
recent.</p>

<p>"Then you never saw July at all?" asked Olly.</p>

<p>"July," queried Jack, reflectively; "what's she like?"</p>

<p>"I don't know whether she's a heart or a spade," said
Olly, as thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Jack was silent for some moments, and then after a
pause, to Olly's intense astonishment, proceeded to sketch,
in a few vigorous phrases, the external characteristics of Mrs.
Conroy.</p>

<p>"Why, you said you never saw her!" ejaculated Olly.</p>

<p>"No more I did," responded the gambler, with a quick
laugh; "this is only a little bluff."</p>

<p>It had grown cold with the brief twilight and the coming
on of night. For some time the black, unchanging outlines
of the distant Coast Range were sharply <i>silhouetted</i> against
a pale, ashen sky, that at last faded utterly, leaving a few
stars behind as emblems of the burnt-out sunset. The red
road presently lost its calm and even outline in the swiftly
gathering shadows, or to Olly's fancy was stopped by shapeless
masses of rock or giant-like trunks of trees that in turn
seemed to give way before the skilful hand and persistent
will of her driver. At times a chill exhalation from a roadside
ditch came to Olly like the damp breath of an open
grave, and the child shivered even beneath the thick travelling
shawl of Mr. Hamlin, with which she was enwrapped.
Whereat Jack at once produced a flask and prevailed upon
Olly to drink something that set her coughing, but which
that astute and experienced child at once recognised as
whisky. Mr. Hamlin, to her surprise, however, did not
himself partake, a fact which she at once pointed out to
him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span></p>

<p>"At an early age, Olly," said Mr. Hamlin, with infinite
gravity, "I promised an infirm and aged relative never to
indulge in spirituous liquors, except on a physician's prescription.
I carry this flask subject to the doctor's orders.
Never having ordered me to drink any, I don't."</p>

<p>As it was too dark for the child to observe Mr. Hamlin's
eyes, which, after the fashion of her sex, she consulted
much oftener than his speech for his real meaning, and
was as often deceived, she said nothing, and Mr. Hamlin
relapsed into silence. At the end of five minutes he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>She</i> was a woman, Olly&mdash;you bet!"</p>

<p>Olly, with great tact and discernment, instantly referring
back to Mr. Hamlin's discourse of an hour before, queried,
"That girl in the Southern country?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Hamlin.</p>

<p>"Tell me all about her," said Olly&mdash;"all you know."</p>

<p>"That ain't much," mused Hamlin, with a slight sigh.
"Ah, Olly, <i>she</i> could sing!"</p>

<p>"With the piano?" said Olly, a little superciliously.</p>

<p>"With the organ," said Hamlin.</p>

<p>Olly, whose sole idea of this instrument was of the
itinerant barrel variety, yawned slightly, and with a very
perceptible lack of interest said that she hoped she would
see her some time when she came up that way and was
"going 'round."</p>

<p>Mr. Hamlin did not laugh, but after a few minutes'
rapid driving, began to explain to Olly with great earnestness
the character of a church organ.</p>

<p>"I used to play once, Olly, in a church. They did say
that I used sometimes to fetch that congregation, jest
snatch 'em bald-headed, Olly, but it's a long time ago!
There was one hymn in particular that I used to run on
consid'rable&mdash;one o' them Masses o' Mozart&mdash;one that I
heard <i>her</i> sing, Olly; it went something like this;" and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
Jack proceeded to lift his voice in the praise of Our Lady
of Sorrows, with a serene unconsciousness to his surroundings,
and utter absorption in his theme that would have
become the most enthusiastic acolyte. The springs creaked,
the wheels rattled, the mare broke, plunged, and recovered
herself, the slight vehicle swayed from side to side, Olly's
hat bruised and flattened itself against his shoulder, and
still Mr. Hamlin sang. When he had finished he looked
down at Olly. She was asleep!</p>

<p>Jack was an artist and an enthusiast, but not unreasonable
nor unforgiving. "It's the whisky," he murmured to
himself, in an apologetic recitation to the air he had just
been singing. He changed the reins to his other hand
with infinite caution and gentleness, slowly passed his disengaged
arm round the swaying little figure, until he had
drawn the chip hat and the golden tresses down upon his
breast and shoulder. In this attitude, scarcely moving a
muscle lest he should waken the sleeping child, at midnight
he came upon the twinkling lights of Fiddletown. Here
he procured a fresh horse, dispensing with an ostler and
harnessing the animal himself, with such noiseless skill and
quickness that Olly, propped up in the buggy with pillows
and blankets borrowed from the Fiddletown hostelry, slept
through it all, nor wakened even after they were again upon
the road, and had begun the long ascent of the Wingdam
turnpike.</p>

<p>It wanted but an hour of daybreak when he reached the
summit, and even then he only slackened his pace when
his wheels sank to their hubs in the beaten dust of the
stage road. The darkness of that early hour was intensified
by the gloom of the heavy pine woods through which the
red road threaded its difficult and devious way. It was
very still. Hamlin could hardly hear the dead, muffled
plunge of his own horse in the dusty track before him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
yet once or twice he stopped to listen. His quick ear
detected the sound of voices and the jingle of Mexican
spurs, apparently approaching behind him. Mr. Hamlin
knew that he had not passed any horseman and was for
a moment puzzled. But then he recalled the fact that a
few hundred yards beyond, the road was intersected by
the "cut-off" to One Horse Gulch, which, after running
parallel with the Wingdam turnpike for half a mile, crossed
it in the forest. The voices were on that road going the
same way. Mr. Hamlin pushed on his horse to the crossing,
and hidden by the darkness and the trunks of the
giant pines, pulled up to let the strangers precede him.
In a few moments the voices were abreast of him and
stationary. The horsemen had apparently halted.</p>

<p>"Here seems to be a road," said a voice quite audibly.</p>

<p>"All right, then," returned another, "it's the 'cut-off.
We'll save an hour, sure."</p>

<p>A third voice here struck in potentially, "Keep the
stage road. If Joe Hall gets wind of what's up, he'll run
his man down to Sacramento for safe keeping. If he does
he'll take this road&mdash;it's the only one&mdash;sabe?&mdash;we can't
miss him!"</p>

<p>Jack Hamlin leaned forward breathlessly in his seat.</p>

<p>"But it's an hour longer this way," growled the second
voice. "The boys will wait," responded the previous
speaker. There was a laugh, a jingling of spurs, and the
invisible procession moved slowly forward in the darkness.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamlin did not stir a muscle until the voices failed
before him in the distance. Then he cast a quick glance
at the child; she still slept quietly, undisturbed by the halt
or those ominous voices which had brought so sudden a
colour into her companion's cheek and so baleful a light in
his dark eyes. Yet for a moment Mr. Hamlin hesitated.
To go forward to Wingdam now would necessitate his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
following cautiously in the rear of the Lynchers, and so
prevent his giving a timely alarm. To strike across to
One Horse Gulch by the "cut-off" would lose him the
chance of meeting the Sheriff and his prisoner, had they
been forewarned and were escaping in time. But for the
impediment of the unconscious little figure beside him, he
would have risked a dash through the party ahead of him.
But that was not to be thought of now. He must follow
them to Wingdam, leave the child, and trust to luck to
reach One Horse Gulch before them. If they delayed a
moment at Wingdam it could be done. A feeling
of yearning tenderness and pity succeeded the slight
impatience with which he had a moment before regarded
his encumbering charge. He held her in his arms,
scarcely daring to breathe lest he should waken her&mdash;hoping
that she might sleep until they reached Wingdam,
and that leaving her with his faithful henchman "Pete," he
might get away before she was aroused to embarrassing
inquiry. Mr. Hamlin had a man's dread of scenes with
even so small a specimen of the sex, and for once in his
life he felt doubtful of his own readiness, and feared lest
in his excitement he might reveal the imminent danger of
her brother. Perhaps he was never before so conscious
of that danger; perhaps he was never before so interested
in the life of any one. He began to see things with Olly's
eyes&mdash;to look upon events with reference to <i>her</i> feelings
rather than his own; if she had sobbed and cried this
sympathetic rascal really believed that he would have cried
too. Such was the unconscious and sincere flattery of
admiration. He was relieved, when with the first streaks
of dawn, his mare wearily clattered over the scattered
river pebbles and "tailings" that paved the outskirts of
Wingdam. He was still more relieved when the Three
Voices of the Night, now faintly visible as three armed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
horsemen, drew up before the verandah of the Wingdam
Hotel, dismounted, and passed into the bar-room. And
he was perfectly content, when a moment later he lifted
the still sleeping Olly in his arms and bore her swiftly yet
cautiously to his room. To awaken the sleeping Pete on
the floor above, and drag him half-dressed and bewildered
into the presence of the unconscious child, as she lay on
Jack Hamlin's own bed, half buried in a heap of shawls
and rugs, was only the work of another moment.</p>

<p>"Why, Mars Jack! Bress de Lord&mdash;it's a chile!" said
Pete, recoiling in sacred awe and astonishment.</p>

<p>"Hold your jaw!" said Jack, in a fierce whisper,
"you'll waken her! Listen to me, you chattering idiot.
Don't waken her, if you want to keep the bones in your
creaking old skeleton whole enough for the doctors to buy.
Let her sleep as long as she can. If she wakes up and
asks after me, tell her I'm gone for her brother. Do you
hear? Give her anything she asks for&mdash;except&mdash;the
truth! What are you doing, you old fool?"</p>

<p>Pete was carefully removing the mountain of shawls and
blankets that Jack had piled upon Olly. "'Fore God,
Mars Jack&mdash;you's smuddering dat chile!" was his only
response. Nevertheless Jack was satisfied with a certain
vague tenderness in his manipulation, and said curtly,
"Get me a horse!"</p>

<p>"It ain't to be did, Mars Jack; de stables is all gone&mdash;cleaned!
Dey's a rush over to One Horse Gulch, all
day!"</p>

<p>"There are three horses at the door," said Jack, with
wicked significance.</p>

<p>"For de love of God, Mars Jack, don't ye do dat!"
ejaculated Pete, in unfeigned and tremulous alarm. "Dey
don't take dem kind o' jokes yer worth a cent&mdash;dey'd be
doin' somefin' awful to ye, sah&mdash;shuah's yer born!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span></p>

<p>But Jack, with the child lying there peaceably in his own
bed, and the Three Voices growing husky in the bar-room
below, regained all his old audacity. "I haven't made up
my mind," continued Jack, coolly, "which of the three I'll
take, but you'll find out from the owner when I do! Tell
him that Mr. Jack Hamlin left his compliments and a mare
and buggy for him. You can say that if he keeps the mare
from breaking and gives her her head down hill, she can
do her mile inside of 2.45. Hush! not a word! Bye-bye."
He turned, lifted the shawl from the fresh cheek of
the sleeping Olly, kissed her, and shaking his fist at Pete,
vanished.</p>

<p>For a few moments the negro listened breathlessly.
And then there came the sharp, quick clatter of hoofs from
the rocky road below, and he sank dejectedly at the foot
of the bed. "He's gone&mdash;done it! Lord save us! but it's
a hangin' matter yer!" And even as he spoke Mr. Jack
Hamlin, mounted on the fleet mustang that had been
ridden by the Potential Voice, with his audacious face
against the red sunrise and his right shoulder squarely
advanced, was butting away the morning mists that rolled
slowly along the river road to One Horse Gulch.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER VI.</h4>

<h5>MR. DUMPHY IS PERPLEXED BY A MOVEMENT IN
REAL ESTATE.</h5>


<p>Mr. Dumphy's confidence in himself was so greatly restored
that several business enterprises of great pith and moment,
whose currents for the past few days had been turned awry,
and so "lost the name of action," were taken up by him
with great vigour and corresponding joy to the humbler
business associates who had asked him just to lend his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
name to that project, and make "a big thing of it." He
had just given his royal sanction and a cheque to an
Association for the Encouragement of Immigration, by the
distribution through the sister States of one million seductive
pamphlets, setting forth the various resources and
advantages of California for the farmer, and proving that
one hundred and fifty dollars spent for a passage thither
was equal to the price of a farm; he had also assisted in
sending the eloquent Mr. Blowhard and the persuasive
Mr. Windygust to present these facts orally to the benighted
dwellers of the East, and had secured the services of two
eminent Californian statisticians to demonstrate the fact,
that more people were killed by lightning and frozen to
death in the streets of New York in a single year than were
ever killed by railroad accidents or human violence in California
during the past three centuries; he had that day
conceived the "truly magnificent plan" of bringing the
waters of Lake Tahoe to San Francisco by ditches, thereby
enabling the citizens to keep the turf in their door-yards
green through the summer. He had started two banks,
a stage line, and a watering place, whose climate and springs
were declared healthful by edict, and were aggressively
advertised; and he had just projected a small suburban
town that should bear his name. He had returned from
this place in high spirits with a company of friends in the
morning after this interview with Poinsett. There was
certainly no trace of the depression of that day in his
manner.</p>

<p>It was a foggy morning, following a clear, still night&mdash;an
atmospheric condition not unusual at that season of the
year to attract Mr. Dumphy's attention, yet he was conscious
on reaching his office of an undue oppressiveness in the air
that indisposed him to exertion, and caused him to remove
his coat and cravat. Then he fell to work upon his morning's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
mail, and speedily forgot the weather. There was a
letter from Mrs. Sepulvida, disclosing the fact that, owing
to the sudden and unaccountable drying up of the springs
on the lower plains, large numbers of her cattle had died
of thirst and were still perishing. This was of serious import
to Mr. Dumphy, who had advanced money on this
perishable stock, and he instantly made a memorandum to
check this sudden freak of Nature, which he at once attributed
to feminine carelessness of management. Further
on Mrs. Sepulvida inquired particularly as to the condition
of the Conroy mine, and displayed a disposition characteristic
of her sex, to realise at once on her investment. Her
letter ended thus: "But I shall probably see you in San
Francisco. Pepe says that this morning the markings on
the beach showed the rise of a tide or wave during the
night higher than any ever known since one thousand eight
hundred. I do not feel safe so near the beach, and shall
rebuild in the spring." Mr. Dumphy smiled grimly to himself.
He had at one time envied Poinsett. But here was
the woman he was engaged to marry, careless, improvident,
with a vast estate, and on the eve of financial disaster
through her carelessness, and yet actually about to take a
journey of two hundred miles because of some foolish,
womanish whim or superstition. It would be a fine thing
if this man, to whom good fortune fell without any effort
on his part&mdash;this easy, elegant supercilious Arthur Poinsett,
who was even indifferent to that good fortune, should find
himself tricked and deceived! should have to apply to him,
Dumphy, for advice and assistance! And this, too, after
his own advice and assistance regarding the claims of
Colonel Starbottle's client had been futile. The revenge
would be complete. Mr. Dumphy rubbed his hands in
prospective satisfaction.</p>

<p>When, a few moments later, Colonel Starbottle's card was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
put into his hand Mr. Dumphy's satisfaction was complete.
This was the day that the gallant Colonel was to call for an
answer; it was evident that Arthur had not seen him, nor
had he made the discovery of Starbottle's unknown client.
The opportunity of vanquishing this man without the aid or
even knowledge of Poinsett was now before him. By way
of preparing himself for the encounter, as well as punishing
the Colonel, he purposely delayed the interview, and for full
five minutes kept his visitor cooling his heels in the outer
office.</p>

<p>He was seated at his desk, ostentatiously preoccupied,
when Colonel Starbottle was at last admitted. He did not
raise his head when the door opened, nor in fact until the
Colonel, stepping lightly forward, walked to Dumphy's side,
and deliberately unhooking his cane from its accustomed
rest on his arm, laid it, pronouncedly, on the desk before
him. The Colonel's face was empurpled, the Colonel's chest
was efflorescent and bursting, the Colonel had the general
effect of being about to boil over the top button of his coat,
but his manner was jauntily and daintily precise.</p>

<p>"One moment!&mdash;a single moment, sir!" he said, with
husky politeness. "Before proceeding to business&mdash;er&mdash;we
will devote a single moment to the necessary explanations
of&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;a gentleman. The kyard now lying before
you, sir, was handed ten minutes ago to one of your subordinates.
I wish to inquire, sir, if it was then delivered to
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Dumphy, impatiently.</p>

<p>Colonel Starbottle leaned over Mr. Dumphy's desk and
coolly rung his bell. Mr. Dumphy's clerk instantly appeared
at the door. "I wish&mdash;" said the Colonel, addressing himself
to the astounded employé as he stood loftily over Mr.
Dumphy's chair&mdash;"I have&mdash;er&mdash;in fact sent for you, to
withdraw the offensive epithets I addressed to you, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
threats&mdash;of er&mdash;of er&mdash;personal violence! The offence&mdash;is
not, yours&mdash;but&mdash;er&mdash;rests with your employer, for whose
apology I am&mdash;er&mdash;now waiting. Nevertheless I am ready,
sir, to hold myself at your service&mdash;that is&mdash;er&mdash;of course&mdash;after
my responsibility&mdash;er&mdash;with your master&mdash;er&mdash;ceases!"</p>

<p>Mr. Dumphy, who in the presence of Colonel Starbottle
felt his former awkwardness return, signed with a forced
smile to his embarrassed clerk to withdraw, and said hastily,
but with an assumption of easy familiarity, "Sorry, Colonel,
sorry, but I was very busy, and am now. No offence. All
a mistake, you know! business man and business hours," and
Mr. Dumphy leaned back in his chair, and emitted his rare
cachinnatory bark.</p>

<p>"Glad to hear it, sir, I accept your apology," said the
Colonel, recovering his good humour and his profanity together,
"hang me, if I didn't think it was another affair like
that I had with old Maje Tolliver, of Georgia. Called on
him in Washington in '48 during session. Boy took up my
kyard. Waited ten minutes, no reply! Then sent friend,
poor Jeff Boomerang, dead now, killed in New Orleans
by Ben Pastor&mdash;with challenge. Hang me, sir, after the
second shot, Maje sends for me, lying thar with hole in
both lungs, gasping for breath. 'It's all a blunder, Star,'
he says, 'boy never brought kyard. Horsewhip the nigger
for me, Star, for I reckon I won't live to do it,' and died
like a gentleman, blank me!"</p>

<p>"What have you got to propose?" said Mr. Dumphy,
hastily, seeing an opportunity to stop the flow of the
Colonel's recollections.</p>

<p>"According to my memory, at our last interview over the
social glass in your own house, I think something was said
of a proposition coming from you. That is&mdash;er," continued
the Colonel, loftily, "I hold myself responsible for the mistake,
if any."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span></p>

<p>It had been Mr. Dumphy's first intention to assume the
roughly offensive; to curtly inform Colonel Starbottle of the
flight of his confederate, and dare him to do his worst. But
for certain vague reasons he changed his plan of tactics.
He drew his chair closer to the Colonel, and clapping his
hand familiarly on his shoulder, began&mdash;</p>

<p>"You're a man of the world, Starbottle, so am I.
<i>Sabe?</i> You're a gentleman&mdash;so am I," he continued,
hastily. "But I'm a business man, and you're not. <i>Sabe?</i>
Let's understand each other. No offence, you know, but
in the way of business. This woman, claiming to be my
wife, don't exist&mdash;it's all right, you know, I understand.
I don't blame <i>you</i>, but you've been deceived, and all that
sort of thing. I've got the proofs. Now as a man of the
world and a gentleman and a business man, when I say the
game's up! you'll understand me. Look at that&mdash;there!"
He thrust into Starbottle's hand the telegram of the
preceding day, "There! the man's hung by this time&mdash;lynched!
The woman's gone!"</p>

<p>Colonel Starbottle read the telegram without any perceptible
dismay or astonishment.</p>

<p>"Conroy! Conroy!&mdash;don't know the man. There was
a McConroy, of St. Jo, but I don't think it's the same.
No, sir! This ain't like him, sir! Don't seem to be a duel,
unless he'd posted the man to kill on sight&mdash;murder's an
ugly word to use to gentlemen. D&mdash;n me, sir, I don't
know but he could hold the man responsible who sent that
despatch. It's offensive, sir&mdash;very!"</p>

<p>"And you don't know Mrs. Conroy?" continued Mr.
Dumphy, fixing his eyes on Colonel Starbottle's face.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Conroy! The wife of the superintendent&mdash;one
of the most beautiful women! Good Ged, sir, I do! And
I'm dev'lish sorry for her. But what's this got to do with
our affair? Oh! I see, Ged!"&mdash;the Colonel suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
chuckled, drew out his handkerchief, and waved it in the
air with deprecatory gallantry, "gossip, sir, all gossip.
People will talk! A fine woman! Blank me, if she was
inclined to show some attention to Colonel Starbottle&mdash;Ged,
sir, it was no more than other women have. You
comprehend, Dumphy? Ged, sir, so the story's got round,
eh?&mdash;husband's jealous&mdash;killed wrong man! Folks think
she's run off with Colonel Starbottle, ha! ha! No, sir,"
he continued, suddenly dropping into an attitude of dignified
severity. "You can say that Colonel Starbottle
branded the story as a lie, sir! That whatever might have
been the foolish indiscretion of a susceptible sex, Colonel
Starbottle will defend the reputation of that lady, sir, with
his life&mdash;with his life!"</p>

<p>Absurd and ridiculous as this sudden diversion of
Colonel Starbottle from the point at issue had become,
Dumphy could not doubt his sincerity, nor the now self-evident
fact that Mrs. Conroy was <i>not</i> his visitor's mysterious
client! Mr. Dumphy felt that his suddenly built up theory
was demolished and his hope with it. He was still at the
mercy of this conceited braggart and the invisible power
behind him&mdash;whoever or whatever it might be. Mr.
Dumphy was not inclined to superstition, but he began to
experience a strange awe of his unknown persecutor, and
resolved at any risk to discover who it was. Could it be
really his wife?&mdash;had not the supercilious Poinsett been
himself tricked&mdash;or was he not now trying to trick him,
Dumphy? Couldn't Starbottle be bribed to expose at
least the name of his client? He would try it.</p>

<p>"I said just now you had been deceived in this
woman who represents herself to be my wife. I find I
have been mistaken in the person, who I believe imposed
upon you, and it is possible that I may be otherwise
wrong. My wife may be alive. I am willing to admit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
it. Bring her here to-morrow and I will accept it as a
fact."</p>

<p>"You forget that she refuses to see you again," said
Colonel Starbottle, "until she has established her claim by
process of law."</p>

<p>"That's so! that's all right, old fellow; <i>we</i> understand
each other. Now, suppose that we business men&mdash;as a
business maxim, you know&mdash;always prefer to deal with
principals. Now suppose we even go so far as to do that
and yet pay an agent's commission, perhaps&mdash;you understand
me&mdash;even a <i>bonus</i>. Good! That's business! You
understand that as a gentleman and a man of the world.
Now, I say, bring me your principal&mdash;fetch along that
woman, and I'll make it all right with <i>you</i>. Stop! I know
what you're going to say; you're bound by honour and all
that&mdash;I understand your position as a gentleman, and
respect it. Then let me know where I can find her!
Understand&mdash;you sha'n't be compromised as bringing
about the interview in any way. I'll see that you're protected
in your commissions from your client; and for my
part&mdash;if a cheque for five thousand dollars will satisfy you
of my desire to do the right thing in this matter, it's at
your service."</p>

<p>The Colonel rose to his feet and applied himself apparently
to the single and silent inflation of his chest, for the
space of a minute. When the upper buttons of his coat
seemed to be on the point of flying off with a report, he
suddenly extended his hand and grasped Dumphy's with
fervour. "Permit me," he said, in a voice husky with
emotion, "to congratulate myself on dealing with a gentleman
and a man of honour. Your sentiments, sir, I don't
care if I do say it, do you credit! I am proud, sir," continued
the Colonel, warmly, "to have made your acquaintance!
But I regret to say, sir, that I cannot give you the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
information you require. I do not myself know the name
or address of my client."</p>

<p>The look of half-contemptuous satisfaction which had
irradiated Dumphy's face at the beginning of this speech,
changed to one of angry suspicion at its close. "That's a
d&mdash;&mdash;d queer oversight of yours," he ejaculated, with an
expression as nearly insulting as he dared to make it.
Colonel Starbottle did not apparently notice the manner of
his speech, but drawing his chair close beside Dumphy, he
laid his hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>"Your confidence as a man of honour and a gentleman,"
he began, "demands equal confidence and frankness
on my part, and Culp. Starbottle of Virginia is not the,
man to withhold it! When I state that I do <i>not</i> know the
name and address of my client, I believe, sir, there is no
one now living, who will&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;require or&mdash;er&mdash;deem
it necessary for me to repeat the assertion! Certainly not,
sir," added the Colonel, lightly waving his hand, "the
gentleman who has just honoured me with his confidence
and invited mine&mdash;I thank you, sir," he continued, as Mr.
Dumphy made a hasty motion of assent, "and will go on."</p>

<p>"It is not necessary for me to name the party who first
put me in possession of the facts. You will take my word
as a gentleman&mdash;er&mdash;that it is some one unknown to you,
of unimportant position, though of strict respectability, and
one who acted only as the agent of my real client. When
the case was handed over to me there was also put into
my possession a sealed envelope containing the name of
my client and principal witness. My injunctions were not
to open it until all negotiations had failed and it was
necessary to institute legal proceedings. That envelope I
have here. You perceive it is unopened!"</p>

<p>Mr. Dumphy unconsciously reached out his hand. With
a gesture of polite deprecation Colonel Starbottle evaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
it, and placing the letter on the table before him, continued,
"It is unnecessary to say that&mdash;er&mdash;there being in my
judgment no immediate necessity for the beginning of a
suit&mdash;the injunctions still restrain me, and I shall not open
the letter. If, however, I accidentally mislay it on this
table and it is returned to me to-morrow, sealed as before,
I believe, sir, as a gentleman and a man of honour I violate
no pledge."</p>

<p>"I see," said Mr. Dumphy, with a short laugh.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, if I venture to require another condition,
merely as a form among men of honour. Write as I dictate."
Mr. Dumphy took up a pen. Colonel Starbottle
placed one hand on his honourable breast and began
slowly and meditatively to pace the length of the room
with the air of a second measuring the distance for his
principal. "Are you ready?"</p>

<p>"Go on," said Dumphy, impatiently.</p>

<p>"I hereby pledge myself&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;that in the event of
any disclosure by me&mdash;er&mdash;of confidential communications
from Colonel Starbottle to me, I shall hold myself ready to
afford him the usual honourable satisfaction&mdash;er&mdash;common
among gentlemen, at such times or places, and with such
weapons as he may choose, without further formality of
challenge, and that&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;failing in that I do thereby
proclaim myself, without posting, a liar, poltroon, and
dastard."</p>

<p>In the full pre-occupation of his dignified composition,
and possibly from an inability to look down over the increased
exaggeration of his swelling breast, Colonel Starbottle
did not observe the contemptuous smile which curled
the lip of his amanuensis. Howbeit Mr. Dumphy signed
the document and handed it to him. Colonel Starbottle
put it in his pocket. Nevertheless he lingered by Mr.
Dumphy's side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span></p>

<p>"The&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;cheque," said the Colonel, with a slight
cough, "had better be to your order, endorsed by you&mdash;to
spare any criticism hereafter."</p>

<p>Mr. Dumphy hesitated a moment. He would have preferred
as a matter of business to have first known the
contents of the envelope, but with a slight smile he dashed
off the cheque and handed it to the Colonel. "If&mdash;er&mdash;it
would not be too much trouble," said the Colonel, jauntily,
"for the same reason just mentioned, would you give that&mdash;er&mdash;piece
of paper to one of your clerks to draw the
money for me?"</p>

<p>Mr. Dumphy impatiently, with his eyes on the envelope,
rang his bell and handed the cheque to the clerk, while
Colonel Starbottle, with an air of abstraction, walked discreetly
to the window.</p>

<p>For the rest of Colonel Starbottle's life he never ceased
to deplore this last act of caution, and regret that he had
not put the cheque in his pocket. For as he walked to
the window the floor suddenly appeared to rise beneath
his feet and as suddenly sank again, and he was thrown
violently against the mantelpiece. He felt sick and giddy.
With a terrible apprehension of apoplexy in his whirling
brain, he turned toward his companion, who had risen
from his seat and was supporting himself by his swinging
desk with a panic-stricken face and a pallor equal to his
own. In another moment a bookcase toppled with a crash
to the floor, a loud outcry arose from the outer offices, and
amidst the sounds of rushing feet, the breaking of glass,
and the creaking of timber, the two men dashed with
a common instinct to the door. It opened two inches and
remained fixed. With the howl of a caged wild beast
Dumphy threw himself against the rattling glass of the
window that opened on the level of the street. In another
instant Colonel Starbottle was beside him on the side-walk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
and the next they were separated, unconsciously, uncaringly,
as if they had been the merest strangers in contact
in a crowd. The business that had brought them together,
the unfinished, incomplete, absorbing interests of a moment
ago were forgotten&mdash;were buried in the oblivion of another
existence, which had no sympathy with this, whose only
instinct was to fly&mdash;where, they knew not!</p>

<p>The middle of the broad street was filled with a crowd
of breathless, pallid, death-stricken men who had lost all
sense but the common instinct of animals. There were
hysterical men, who laughed loudly without a cause, and
talked incessantly of what they knew not. There were
dumb, paralysed men, who stood helplessly and hopelessly
beneath cornices and chimneys that toppled over and
crushed them. There were automatic men, who flying,
carried with them the work on which they were engaged&mdash;one
whose hands were full of bills and papers, another who
held his ledger under his arm. There were men who had
forgotten the ordinary instincts of decency&mdash;some half-dressed.
There were men who rushed from the fear of
death into its presence; two were picked up, one who had
jumped through a skylight, another who had blindly leaped
from a fourth-story window. There were brave men who
trembled like children; there was one whose life had been
spent in scenes of daring and danger, who cowered paralysed
in the corner of the room from which a few inches
of plastering had fallen. There were hopeful men who
believed that the danger was over, and having passed,
would, by some mysterious law, never recur; there were
others who shook their heads and said that the next shock
would be fatal. There were crowds around the dust that
arose from fallen chimneys and cornices, around runaway
horses that had dashed as madly as their drivers against
lamp-posts, around telegraph and newspaper offices eager<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
to know the extent of the disaster. Along the remoter
avenues and cross-streets dwellings were deserted, people
sat upon their doorsteps or in chairs upon the sidewalks,
fearful of the houses they had built with their own hands,
and doubtful even of this blue arch above them that smiled
so deceitfully; of those far-reaching fields beyond, which
they had cut into lots and bartered and sold, and which
now seemed to suddenly rise against them, or slip and
wither away from their very feet. It seemed so outrageous
that this dull, patient earth, whose homeliness they had
adorned and improved, and which, whatever their other
fortune or vicissitudes, at least had been their sure inheritance,
should have become so faithless. Small wonder that
the owner of a little house, which had sunk on the reclaimed
water front, stooped in the speechless and solemn
absurdity of his wrath to shake his clenched fist in the face
of the Great Mother.</p>

<p>The real damage to life and property had been so slight
and in such pronounced contrast to the prevailing terror,
that half an hour later only a sense of the ludicrous
remained with the greater masses of the people. Mr.
Dumphy, like all practical, unimaginative men, was among
the first to recover his presence of mind with the passing
of the immediate danger. People took confidence when
this great man, who had so much to lose, after sharply
remanding his clerks and everybody else back to business,
re-entered his office. He strode at once to his desk. But
the envelope was gone! He looked hurriedly among his
papers&mdash;on the floor&mdash;by the broken window&mdash;but in
vain.</p>

<p>Mr. Dumphy instantly rang his bell. The clerk appeared.</p>

<p>"Was that draft paid?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; we were counting the money when"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stop it!&mdash;return the draft to me."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span></p>

<p>The young man was confiding to his confrères his suspicions
of a probable "run" on the bank as indicated by
Mr. Dumphy's caution, when he was again summoned by
Mr. Dumphy.</p>

<p>"Go to Mr. Poinsett's office and ask him to come here
at once."</p>

<p>In a few moments the clerk returned out of breath.</p>

<p>"Mr. Poinsett left a quarter of an hour ago, sir, for San
Antonio."</p>

<p>"San Antonio?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;they say there's bad news from the Mission."</p>

<h4>CHAPTER VII.</h4>

<h5>IN WHICH BOTH JUSTICE AND THE HEAVENS FALL.</h5>


<p>The day following the discovery of the murder of Victor
Ramirez was one of the intensest excitement in One Horse
Gulch. It was not that killing was rare in that pastoral
community&mdash;foul murder had been done there upon the
bodies of various citizens of more or less respectability,
and the victim in the present instance was a stranger and
a man who awakened no personal sympathy; but the suspicion
that swiftly and instantly attached to two such
important people as Mr. and Mrs. Conroy, already objects
of severe criticism, was sufficient to exalt this particular
crime above all others in thrilling interest. For two days
business was practically suspended.</p>

<p>The discovery of the murder was made by Sal, who
stumbled upon the body of the unfortunate Victor early
the next morning during a walk on Conroy's Hill, manifestly
in search of the missing man, who had not returned
to the hotel that night. A few flippant souls, misunderstanding
Miss Clark's interest in the stranger, asserted that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
he had committed suicide to escape her attentions, but all
jocular hypothesis ceased when it became known that
Gabriel and his wife had fled. Then came the report that
Gabriel had been seen by a passing miner early in the day
"shoving" the stranger along the trail, with his hand on
his collar, and exchanging severe words. Then the willing
testimony of Miss Clark that she had seen Mrs. Conroy
in secret converse with Victor before the murder; then
the unwilling evidence of the Chinaman who had overtaken
Gabriel with the letter, but who heard the sounds of
quarrelling and cries for help in the bushes after his departure;
but this evidence was excluded from the inquest, by
virtue of the famous Californian law that a Pagan was of
necessity a liar, and that truth only resided in the breast
of the Christian Caucasian, and was excluded from the
general public for its incompatibility with Gabriel's subsequent
flight, and the fact that the Chinaman, being a fool,
was probably mistaken in the hour. Then there was the
testimony of the tunnel-men to Gabriel's appearance on
the hill that night. There was only one important proof
not submitted to the public or the authorities&mdash;Mrs. Conroy's
note&mdash;picked up by Sal, handed to Mrs. Markle, and
given by her to Lawyer Maxwell. The knowledge of this
document was restricted to the few already known to the
reader.</p>

<p>A dozen or more theories of the motive of the deed at
different hours of the day occupied and disturbed the
public mind. That Gabriel had come upon a lover of his
wife in the act of eloping with her, and had slain him out
of hand, was the first. That Gabriel had decoyed the
man to an interview by simulating his wife's handwriting,
and then worked his revenge on his body, was accepted
later as showing the necessary deliberation to constitute
murder. That Gabriel and his wife had conjointly taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
this method to rid themselves of a former lover who
threatened exposure, was a still later theory. Towards
evening, when One Horse Gulch had really leisure to put
its heads together, it was generally understood that Gabriel
and Mrs. Conroy had put out of their way a dangerous
and necessarily rightful claimant to that mine which Gabriel
had pretended to discover. This opinion was for some
time&mdash;say two hours&mdash;the favourite one, agreeing as it did
with the popular opinion of Gabriel's inability to discover
a mine himself, and was only modified by another theory
that Victor was not the real claimant, but a dangerous
witness that the Conroys had found it necessary to dispose
of. And when, possibly from some unguarded expression
of Lawyer Maxwell, it was reported that Gabriel Conroy
was an impostor under an assumed name, all further speculation
was deemed unnecessary. The coroner's jury brought
in a verdict against "John Doe, alias Gabriel Conroy," and
One Horse Gulch added this injury of false pretence to
other grievances complained of. One or two cases of
horse-stealing and sluice-robbing in the neighbourhood
were indefinitely but strongly connected with this discovery.
If I am thus particular in citing these evidences of the
various gradations of belief in the guilt of the accused, it
is because they were peculiar to One Horse Gulch, and of
course never obtained in more civilised communities.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to say that one person in One
Horse Gulch never wavered in her opinion of Gabriel's
innocence, nor that that person was Mrs. Markle. That
he was the victim of a vile conspiracy&mdash;that Mrs. Conroy
was the real culprit, and had diabolically contrived to fasten
the guilt upon her husband, Mrs. Markle not only believed
herself, but absolutely contrived to make Lawyer Maxwell
and Sal believe also. More than that, it had undoubtedly
great power in restraining Sal's evidence before the inquest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
which that impulsive and sympathetic young woman persisted
in delivering behind a black veil and in a suit of the
deepest mourning that could be hastily improvised in One
Horse Gulch.</p>

<p>"Miss Clark's evidence," said the <i>Silveropolis Messenger</i>,
"although broken by sobs and occasional expressions of
indignation against the murderer, strongly impressed the
jury as the natural eloquence of one connected with the
tenderest ties to the unfortunate victim. It is said that she
was an old acquaintance of Ramirez, who was visiting her
in the hope of inducing her to consent to a happy termination
of a life-long courtship, when the dastard hand of the
murderer changed the bridal wreath to the veil of mourning.
From expressions that dropped from the witness's lips, although
restrained by natural modesty, it would not be
strange if jealousy were shown to be one of the impelling
causes. It is said that previous to his marriage the alleged
Gabriel Conroy was a frequent visitor at the house of Miss
Clark."</p>

<p>I venture to quote this extract not so much for its suggestion
of a still later theory in the last sentence, as for its
poetical elegance, and as an offset to the ruder record of
the <i>One Horse Gulch Banner</i>, which, I grieve to say, was
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Sal was no slouch of a witness. Rigged out in ten yards of Briggs'
best black glazed muslin, and with a lot of black mosquito netting round
her head, she pranced round the stand like a skittish hearse horse in fly-time.
If Sal calculates to go into mourning for every man she has to
sling hash to, we'd recommend her to buy up Briggs' stock and take
one of Pat Hoolan's carriages for the season. There is a strong feeling
among men whose heads are level, that this Minstrel Variety Performance
is a bluff of the <i>Messenger</i> to keep from the public the real
motives of the murderer, which it is pretty generally believed concerns
some folks a little higher-toned than Sal. We mention no names but
we would like to know what the Editor of the <i>Messenger</i> was doing in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>the counting-room of one of Pete Dumphy's emissaries at ten o'clock
last evening. Looking up his bank account, eh? What's the size of
the figures to-day? You hear us!"</p></blockquote>

<p>At one o'clock that morning the Editor of the <i>Messenger</i>
fired at the Editor of the <i>Banner</i> and missed him. At
half-past one two men were wounded by pistol shots in a
difficulty at Briggs' warehouse&mdash;cause not stated. At nine
o'clock half a dozen men lounged down the main street
and ascended the upper loft of Briggs' warehouse. In ten
or fifteen minutes a dozen more from different saloons in
the town lounged as indifferently in the direction of Briggs',
until at half-past nine the assemblage in the loft numbered
fifty men. During this interval a smaller party had gathered,
apparently as accidentally and indefinitely as to purpose, on
the steps of the little two-story brick Court House in which
the prisoner was confined. At ten o'clock a horse was furiously
ridden into town, and dropped exhausted at the outskirts.
A few moments later a man hurriedly crossed the plaza
toward the Court House. It was Mr. Jack Hamlin. But the
Three Voices had preceded him, and from the steps of the
Court House were already uttering the popular mandate.</p>

<p>It was addressed to a single man. A man who, deserted
by his <i>posse</i>, and abandoned by his friends, had for the last
twelve hours sat beside his charge, tireless, watchful, defiant,
and resolute&mdash;Joe Hall, the Sheriff of Calaveras! He had
been waiting for this summons, behind barricaded doors,
with pistols in his belt, and no hope in his heart; a man of
limited ideas and restricted resources, constant only to one
intent&mdash;that of dying behind those bars, in defence of that
legal trust, which his office and an extra fifty votes at the
election only two months before had put into his hands.
It had perplexed him for a moment that he heard the voices
of some of these voters below him clamouring against him,
but above their feebler pipe always rose another mandatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
sentence, "We command you to take and safely keep the
body of Gabriel Conroy," and being a simple man the recollection
of the quaint phraseology strengthened him and cleared
his mind. Ah me, I fear he had none of the external marks
of a hero; as I remember him he was small, indistinctive,
and fidgety, without the repose of strength; a man who at
that extreme moment chewed tobacco and spat vigorously on
the floor; who tweaked the ends of his scanty beard, paced
the floor, and tried the locks of his pistols. Presently he
stopped before Gabriel and said almost fiercely&mdash;</p>

<p>"You hear that&mdash;they are coming!"</p>

<p>Gabriel nodded. Two hours before, when the contemplated
attack of the Vigilance Committee had been revealed
to him, he had written a few lines to Lawyer Maxwell,
which he entrusted to the sheriff. He had then relapsed
into his usual tranquillity&mdash;serious, simple, and when he
had occasion to speak, diffident and apologetic.</p>

<p>"Are you going to help me?" continued Hall.</p>

<p>"In course," said Gabriel, in quiet surprise, "ef <i>you</i> say
so. But don't ye do nowt ez would be gettin' yourself into
troubil along o' me. I ain't worth it. Maybe it 'ud be
jest as square ef ye handed me over to them chaps out yer&mdash;allowin'
I was a heep o' troubil to you&mdash;and reckonin'
you'd about hed <i>your sheer</i> o' the keer o' me, and kinder
passin' me round. But ef you <i>do</i> feel obligated to take
keer o' me, ez hevin' promised the jedges and jury" (it is
almost impossible to convey the gentle deprecatoriness of
Gabriel's voice and accent at this juncture), "why," he
added, "I'm with ye. I'm thar! You understand me!"</p>

<p>He rose slowly, and with quiet but powerfully significant
deliberation placed the chair he had been sitting on back
against the wall. The tone and act satisfied the sheriff.
The seventy-four gunship, Gabriel Conroy, was clearing
the decks for action.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span></p>

<p>There was an ominous lull in the outcries below, and then
the solitary lifting up of a single voice, the Potential Voice
of the night before! The sheriff walked to a window in the
hall and opened it. The besieger and besieged measured
each other with a look. Then came the Homeric chaff:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Git out o' that, Joe Hall, and run home to your mother.
She's getting oneasy about ye!"</p>

<p>"The h&mdash;ll you say!" responded Hall, promptly, "and
the old woman in such a hurry she had to borry Al
Barker's hat and breeches to come here! Run home, old
gal, and don't parse yourself off for a man agin!"</p>

<p>"This ain't no bluff, Joe Hall! Why don't ye call?
Yer's fifty men; the returns are agin ye, and two precincts
yet to hear from." (This was a double thrust, at Hall's
former career as a gambler, and the closeness of his late
election vote.)</p>

<p>"All right! send 'em up by express&mdash;mark 'em C. O. D."
(The previous speaker was the expressman.)</p>

<p>"Blank you! Git!"</p>

<p>"Blank you! Come on!"</p>

<p>Here there was a rush at the door, the accidental discharge
of a pistol, and the window was slammed down.
Words ceased, deeds began.</p>

<p>A few hours before, Hall had removed his prisoner from
the uncertain tenure and accessible position of the cells
below to the open court-room of the second floor, inaccessible
by windows, and lit by a skylight in the roof, above
the reach of the crowd, whose massive doors were barricaded
by benches and desks. A smaller door at the side,
easily secured, was left open for reconnoitring. The
approach to the court-room was by a narrow stairway,
halfway down whose length Gabriel had thrust the long
court-room table as a barricade to the besiegers. The
lower outer door, secured by the sheriff after the desertion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
of his underlings, soon began to show signs of weakening
under the vigorous battery from without. From the landing
the two men watched it eagerly. As it slowly yielded,
the sheriff drew back toward the side door and beckoned
Gabriel to follow; but with a hasty sign Gabriel suddenly
sprang forward and dropped beneath the table as the door
with a crash fell inward, beaten from its hinges. There
was a rush of trampling feet to the stairway, a cry of baffled
rage over the impeding table, a sudden scramble up and
upon it, and then, as if on its own volition, the long table
suddenly reared itself on end, and staggering a moment
toppled backward with its clinging human burden on the
heads of the thronging mass below. There was a cry, a
sudden stampede of the Philistines to the street, and
Samson, rising to his feet, slowly walked to the side door,
and re-entered the court-room. But at the same instant
an agile besieger who, unnoticed, had crossed the Rubicon,
darted from his concealment, and dashed by Gabriel into
the room. There was a shout from the sheriff, the door
was closed hastily, a shot, and the intruder fell. But the
next moment he staggered to his knees, with outstretched
hands, "Hold up! I'm yer to help ye!"</p>

<p>It was Jack Hamlin! haggard, dusty, grimy; his gay
feathers bedraggled, his tall hat battered, his spotless shirt
torn open at the throat, his eyes and cheeks burning with
fever, the blood dripping from the bullet wound in his leg,
but still Jack Hamlin, strong and audacious. By a common
instinct both men dropped their weapons, ran and
lifted him in their arms.</p>

<p>"There&mdash;shove that chair under me! that'll do," said
Hamlin, coolly, "We're even now, Joe Hall; that shot
wiped out old scores, even if it has crippled me, and lost
ye my valuable aid. Dry up! and listen to me, and then
leave me here! there's but one way of escape. It's up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
there!" (he pointed to the skylight) "the rear wall hangs
over the Wingdam ditch and gully. Once on the roof you
can drop over with this rope, which you must unwind from
my body, for I'm d&mdash;d if I can do it myself. Can you
reach the skylight?"</p>

<p>"There's a step-ladder from the gallery," said the
sheriff, joyously, "but won't they see us, and be prepared?"</p>

<p>"Before they can reach the gully by going round, you'll
be half a mile away in the woods. But what in blank are
you waiting for? Go! You can hold on here for ten
minutes more if they attack the same point; but if they
think of the skylight, and fetch ladders, you're gone in!
Go!"</p>

<p>There was another rush on the staircase without; the
surging of an immense wave against the heavy folding
doors, the blows of pick and crowbar, the gradual yielding
of the barricade a few inches, and the splintering of
benches by a few pistol shots fired through the springing
crevices of the doors. And yet the sheriff hesitated.
Suddenly Gabriel stooped down, lifted the wounded man
to his shoulder as if he had been an infant, and beckoning
to the sheriff started for the gallery. But he had not
taken two steps before he staggered and lapsed heavily
against Hall, who, in his turn, stopped and clutched the
railing. At the same moment the thunder of the besiegers
seemed to increase; not only the door, but the windows
rattled, the heavy chandelier fell with a crash, carrying a
part of the plaster and the elaborate cornice with it, a
shower of bricks fell through the skylight, and a cry, quite
distinct from anything heard before, rose from without.
There was a pause in the hall, and then the sudden rush
of feet down the staircase, and all was still again. The
three men gazed in each other's whitened faces.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span></p>

<p>"An earthquake," said the sheriff.</p>

<p>"So much the better," said Jack. "It gives us time&mdash;forward!"</p>

<p>They reached the gallery and the little step-ladder that
led to a door that opened upon the roof, Gabriel preceding
with his burden. There was another rush up the staircase
without the court room, but this time there was no
yielding in the door; the earthquake that had shaken the
foundations and settled the walls had sealed it firmly.</p>

<p>Gabriel was first to step out on the roof, carrying Jack
Hamlin. But as he did so another thrill ran through the
building and he dropped on his knees to save himself from
falling, while the door closed smartly behind him. In
another moment the shock had passed, and Gabriel, putting
down his burden, turned to open the door for the sheriff.
But to his alarm it did not yield to his pressure; the
earthquake had sealed it as it had the door below, and Joe
Hall was left a prisoner.</p>

<p>It was Gabriel's turn to hesitate and look at his companion.
But Jack was gazing into the street below.
Then he looked up and said, "We must go on now,
Gabriel,&mdash;for&mdash;for <i>they've got a ladder</i>!"</p>

<p>Gabriel rose again to his feet and lifted the wounded
man. The curve of the domed roof was slight; in the
centre, on a rough cupola or base, the figure of Justice,
fifteen feet high, rudely carved in wood, towered above
them with drawn sword and dangling scales. Gabriel
reached the cupola and crouched behind it, as a shout rose
from the street below that told he was discovered. A few
shots were fired, one bullet imbedded itself in the naked
blade of the Goddess, and another with cruel irony,
shattered the equanimity of her balance. "Unwind the
cord from me," said Hamlin. Gabriel did so. "Fasten
one end to the chimney or the statue." But the chimney<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
was levelled by the earthquake, and even the statue was
trembling on its pedestal. Gabriel secured the rope to
an iron girder of the skylight, and crawling on the roof
dropped it cautiously over the gable. But it was several
feet too short&mdash;too far for a cripple to drop! Gabriel
crawled back to Hamlin. "You must go first," he said,
quietly, "I will hold the rope over the gable. You can
trust me."</p>

<p>Without waiting for Hamlin's reply he fastened the rope
under his arms and half-lifted, half-dragged him to the
gable. Then pressing his hand silently, he laid himself
down and lowered the wounded man safely to the ground.
He had recovered the rope again, and crawling to the
cupola, was about to fasten the line to the iron girder when
something slowly rose above the level of the roof beyond
him. The uprights of a ladder!</p>

<p>The Three Voices had got tired of waiting a reply to
their oft-reiterated question, and had mounted the ladder
by way of forcing an answer at the muzzles of their
revolvers. They reached the level of the roof, one after
another, and again propounded their inquiry. And then
as it seemed to their awe-stricken fancy, the only figure
there&mdash;the statue of Justice&mdash;awoke to their appeal.
Awoke! leaned towards them; advanced its awful sword
and shook its broken balance, and then toppling forward
with one mighty impulse, came down upon them, swept
them from the ladder, and silenced the Voices for ever!
And from behind its pedestal Gabriel arose, panting, pale,
but triumphant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER VIII.</h4>

<h5>IN TENEBRIS SERVARE FIDEM.</h5>


<p>Although a large man, Gabriel was lithe and active, and
dropped the intervening distance where the rope was scant,
lightly, and without injury. Happily the falling of the
statue was looked upon as the result of another earthquake
shock, and its disastrous effect upon the storming party for
awhile checked the attack. Gabriel lifted his half-fainting
ally in his arms, and gaining the friendly shelter of the
ditch, in ten minutes was beyond the confines of One Horse
Gulch, and in the shadow of the pines of Conroy's Hill.
There were several tunnel openings only known to him.
Luckily the first was partly screened by a fall of rock
loosened by the earthquake from the hill above, and satisfied
that it would be unrecognised by any eye less keen
than his own, Gabriel turned into it with his fainting
burden. And it was high time. For the hæmorrhage
from Jack Hamlin's wound was so great that that gentleman,
after a faint attempt to wave his battered hat above
his dishevelled curls, suddenly succumbed, and lay as cold
and senseless and beautiful as a carven Apollo.</p>

<p>Then Gabriel stripped him, and found an ugly hole in
his thigh that had narrowly escaped traversing the femoral
artery, and set himself about that rude surgery which he
had acquired by experience, and that more delicate nursing
which was instinctive with him. He was shocked at the
revelation of a degree of emaciation in the figure of this
young fellow that he had not before suspected. Gabriel
had nursed many sick men, and here was one who clearly
ought to be under the doctor's hands, economising his
vitality as a sedentary invalid, who had shown himself to
him hitherto only as a man of superabundant activity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
animal spirits. Whence came the power that had animated
this fragile shell? Gabriel was perplexed; he looked
down upon his own huge frame with a new and sudden
sense of apology and depreciation, as if it were an offence
to this spare and bloodless Adonis.</p>

<p>And then with an infinite gentleness, as of a young
mother over her newborn babe, he stanched the blood and
bound up the wounds of his new friend, so skilfully that he
never winced, and with a peculiar purring accompaniment
that lulled him to repose. Once only, as he held him in
his arms, did he change his expression, and that was when
a shadow and a tread&mdash;perhaps of a passing hare or
squirrel&mdash;crossed the mouth of his cave, when he suddenly
caught the body to his breast with the fierceness of a
lioness interrupted with her cubs. In his own rough experience
he was much awed by the purple and fine linen
of this fine gentleman's underclothing&mdash;not knowing the
prevailing habits of his class&mdash;and when he had occasion
to open his bosom to listen to the faint beatings of his
heart, he put aside with great delicacy and instinctive
honour a fine gold chain from which depended some few
relics and keepsakes which this scamp wore. But one was
a photograph, set in an open locket, that he could not fail
to see, and that at once held him breathless above it. It
was the exact outline and features of his sister Grace, but
with a strange shadow over that complexion which he
remembered well as beautiful, that struck him with superstitious
awe. He scanned it again eagerly. "Maybe it
was a dark day when she sot!" he murmured softly to
himself; "maybe it's the light in this yer tunnel; maybe
the heat o' this poor chap's buzzum hez kinder turned it.
It ain't measles, fur she hed 'em along o' Olly." He
paused and looked at the unconscious man before him, as
if trying to connect him with the past. "No," he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
simply, with a resigned sigh, "it's agin reason! She never
knowed him! It's only my foolishness, and my thinkin'
and thinkin' o' her so much! It's another gal, and none
o' your business, Gabe, and you a' prying inter another
man's secrets, and takin' advantage of him when he's
down." He hurriedly replaced it in his companion's
bosom, and closed the collar of his shirt, as Jack's lips
moved. "Pete!" he called, feebly.</p>

<p>"It's his pardner, maybe, he's callin' on," said Gabriel
to himself; then aloud, with the usual, comforting professional
assent, "In course, Pete, surely! He's coming,
right off&mdash;he'll be yer afore you know it."</p>

<p>"Pete," continued Jack, forcibly, "take the mare off
my leg, she's breaking it! Don't you see? She's stumbled!
D&mdash;n it, quick! I'll be late. They'll string him up before
I get there!"</p>

<p>In a moment Gabriel's stout heart sank. If fever should
set in&mdash;if he should become delirious, they would be lost.
Providentially, however, Jack's aberration was only for a
moment; he presently opened his black eyes and stared at
Gabriel. Gabriel smiled assuringly. "Am I dead and
buried," said Jack, gravely, looking around the dark vault,
"or have I got 'em again?"</p>

<p>"Ye wuz took bad fur a minit&mdash;that's all," said Gabriel,
reassuringly, much relieved himself, "yer all right now!"</p>

<p>Hamlin tried to rise but could not. "That's a lie," he
said, cheerfully. "What's to be done?"</p>

<p>"Ef you'd let me hev my say, without gettin' riled," said
Gabriel, apologetically, "I'd tell ye. Look yer," he continued,
persuasively, "ye ought to hev a doctor afore thet
wound gets inflamed; and ye ain't goin' to get one, bein'
packed round by me. Now don't ye flare up, but harkin!
Allowin' I goes out to them chaps ez is huntin' us, and sez,
'look yer, you kin take me, provided ye don't bear no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
malice agin my friend, and you sends a doctor to fetch him
outer the tunnel.' Don't yer see, they can't prove anythin'
agin ye, anyway," continued Gabriel, with a look of the
intensest cunning, "I'll swear I took you pris'ner, and Joe
won't go back on his shot."</p>

<p>In spite of his pain and danger this proposition afforded
Jack Hamlin apparently the largest enjoyment. "Thank
ye," he said, with a smile, "but as there's a warrant, by this
time, out against me for horse-stealing, I reckon I won't put
myself in the way of their nursing. They might forgive
you for killing a Mexican of no great market value, but they
ain't goin' to extend the right hand of fellowship to me after
running off with their ringleader's mustang! Particularly when
that animal's foundered and knee-sprung. No, sir!"</p>

<p>Gabriel stared at his companion without speaking.</p>

<p>"I was late coming back with Olly to Wingdam. I had
to swap the horse and buggy for the mare without having
time to arrange particulars with the owner. I don't wonder
you're shocked," continued Jack, mischievously, affecting
to misunderstand Gabriel's silence, "but thet's me. Thet's
the kind of company you've got into. Procrastination and
want of punctuality has brought me to this. Never procrastinate,
Gabriel. Always make it a point to make it a
rule, never to be late at the Sabbath school!"</p>

<p>"Ef I hed owt to give ye," said Gabriel, ruefully, "a
drop o' whisky, or suthin' to keep up your stren'th!"</p>

<p>"I never touch intoxicating liquors without the consent
of my physician," said Jack, gravely, "they're too exciting!
I must be kept free from all excitement. Something soothing,
or sedentary like this," he added, striking his leg.
But even through his mischievous smile his face paled, and
a spasm of pain crossed it.</p>

<p>"I reckon we'll hev to stick yer ontil dark," said Gabriel,
"and then strike acrost the gully to the woods on Conroy's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
Hill. Ye'll be easier thar, and we're safe ontil sun-up,
when we kin hunt another tunnel. Thar ain't no choice,"
added Gabriel, apologetically.</p>

<p>Jack made a grimace, and cast a glance around the walls
of the tunnel. The luxurious scamp missed his usual comfortable
surroundings. "Well," he assented, with a sigh,
"I suppose the game's made anyway! and we've got to
stick here like snails on a rock for an hour yet. Well," he
continued, impatiently, as Gabriel, after improvising a rude
couch for him with some withered pine tassels gathered at
the mouth of the tunnel, sat down beside him, "are you
goin' to bore me to death, now that you've got me here&mdash;sittin'
there like an owl? Why don't you say something?"</p>

<p>"Say what?" asked Gabriel, simply.</p>

<p>"Anything! Lie if you want to; only talk!"</p>

<p>"I'd like to put a question to ye, Mr. Hamlin," said
Gabriel, with great gentleness,&mdash;"allowin' in course, ye'll
answer or no jest ez as is agree'ble to ye&mdash;reckonin' it's no
business o' mine nor pryin' into secrets, ony jess to pass
away the time ontil sundown. When you was tuk bad a
spell ago, unloosin' yer shirt thar, I got to see a pictur that
ye hev around yer neck. I ain't askin' who nor which it is&mdash;but
ony this&mdash;ez thet&mdash;thet&mdash;thet young woman dark
complected ez that picter allows her to be?"</p>

<p>Jack's face had recovered its colour by the time that
Gabriel had finished, and he answered promptly, "A d&mdash;d
sight more so! Why, that picture's fair alongside of her!"</p>

<p>Gabriel looked a little disappointed, Hamlin was instantly
up in arms. "Yes, sir&mdash;and when I say that," he
returned, "I mean, by thunder, that the whitest faced woman
in the world don't begin to be as handsome. Thar ain't an
angel that she couldn't give points to and beat! That's <i>her</i>
style! It don't," continued Mr. Hamlin, taking the picture
from his breast, and wiping its face with his handkerchief&mdash;"it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
don't begin to do her justice. What," he asked suddenly
and aggressively, "have <i>you</i> got to say about it,
anyway?"</p>

<p>"I reckoned it kinder favoured my sister Grace," said
Gabriel, submissively. "Ye didn't know her, Mr. Hamlin?
She was lost sence '49&mdash;thet's all!"</p>

<p>Mr. Hamlin measured Gabriel with a contempt that was
delicious in its sublime audacity and unconsciousness.
"Your sister?" he repeated, "that's a healthy lookin' <i>sister</i>
of such a man as you&mdash;ain't it? Why, look at it," roared
Jack, thrusting the picture under Gabriel's nose. "Why,
it's&mdash;it's a <i>lady</i>!"</p>

<p>"Ye musn't jedge Gracey by me, nor even Olly," interposed
Gabriel, gently, evading Mr. Hamlin's contempt.</p>

<p>But Jack was not to be appeased, "Does your sister
sing like an angel, and talk Spanish like Governor Alvarado:
is she connected with one of the oldest Spanish families in
the state; does she run a rancho and thirty square leagues
of land, and is Dolores Salvatierra her nickname? Is her
complexion like the young bark of the madroño&mdash;the
most beautiful thing ever seen&mdash;did every other woman
look chalky beside her, eh?"</p>

<p>"No!" said Gabriel, with a sigh&mdash;"it was just my foolishness,
Mr. Hamlin. But seein' that picter, kinder"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I stole it," interrupted Jack, with the same frankness.
"I saw it in her parlour, on the table, and I froze to it when
no one was looking. Lord, <i>she</i> wouldn't have given it to
<i>me</i>. I reckon those relatives of hers would have made it
very lively for me if they'd suspected it. Hoss stealing ain't
a circumstance to this, Gabriel," said Jack, with a reckless
laugh. Then with equal frankness, and a picturesque freedom
of description, he related his first and only interview
with Donna Dolores. I am glad to say that this scamp
exaggerated, if anything, the hopelessness of his case, dwelt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
but slightly on his own services, and concealed the fact that
Donna Dolores had even thanked him. "You can reckon
from this the extent of my affection for that Johnny Ramirez,
and why I just froze to you when I heard you'd dropped
him. But come now, it's your deal; tell us all about it.
The boys put it up that he was hangin' round your wife,&mdash;and
you went for him for all he was worth. Go on&mdash;I'm
waiting&mdash;and," added Jack, as a spasm of pain passed
across his face, "and aching to that degree that I'll yell
if you don't take my mind off it."</p>

<p>But Gabriel's face was grave and his lips silent as he bent
over Mr. Hamlin to adjust the bandages. "Go on," said
Jack, darkly, "or I'll tear off these rags and bleed to death
before your eyes. What are you afraid of? I know all
about your wife&mdash;you can't tell me anything about her.
Didn't I spot her in Sacramento&mdash;before she married you&mdash;when
she had this same Chilino, Ramirez, on a string. Why,
she's fooled him as she has you. You ain't such a blasted
fool as to be stuck after her still, are you?" and Jack raised
himself on his elbow the more intently to regard this possible
transcendent idiot.</p>

<p>"You was speakin' o' this Mexican, Ramirez," said
Gabriel, after a pause, fixing his now clear and untroubled
eyes on his interlocutor.</p>

<p>"Of course," roared out Jack, impatiently, "did you
think I was talking of&mdash;&mdash;?" Here Mr. Hamlin offered a
name that suggested the most complete and perfect antithesis
known to modern reason.</p>

<p>"I didn't kill him!" said Gabriel, quietly.</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Jack, promptly. "He sorter
stumbled and fell over on your bowie-knife as you were
pickin' your teeth with it. But go on&mdash;how did you do it?
Where did you spot him? Did he make any fight? Has
he got any sand in him?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span></p>

<p>"I tell ye I didn't kill him!"</p>

<p>"Who did, then?" screamed Jack, furious with pain and
impatience.</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;I reckon&mdash;that is&mdash;&mdash;" and Gabriel
stopped short with a wistful perplexed look at his
companion.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, Mr. Gabriel Conroy," said Jack, with sudden
coolness and deliberation of speech, and a baleful light in
his dark eyes, "perhaps you'll be good enough to tell me
what this means&mdash;what <i>is</i> your little game? Perhaps you'll
kindly inform me what I'm lying here crippled for? What
you were doing up in the Court House, when you were
driving those people crazy with excitement? What you're
hiding here in this blank family vault for? And maybe, if
you've got time, you'll tell me what was the reason I made
that pleasant little trip to Sacramento? I know I required
the exercise, and then there was the honour of being introduced
to your little sister&mdash;but perhaps you'll tell me
WHAT IT WAS FOR!"</p>

<p>"Jack," said Gabriel, leaning forward, with a sudden return
of his old trouble and perplexity, "I thought <i>she</i> did
it! and thinkin' that&mdash;when they asked me&mdash;I took it upon
<i>myself</i>! I didn't know to ring <i>you</i> into this, Jack! I thought&mdash;I
thought&mdash;thet&mdash;it 'ud all be one&mdash;thet they'd hang me
up afore this&mdash;I did, Jack, honest!"</p>

<p>"And you didn't kill Ramirez?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"And you reckoned your wife did?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you took the thing on yourself?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> did!"</p>

<p>"I did!"</p>

<p>"You <span class="smcap">DID</span>?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span></p>

<p>"I did!"</p>

<p>Mr. Hamlin rolled over on his back, and began to whistle
"When the spring time comes, gentle Annie!" as the
only way of expressing his inordinate contempt for the
whole proceeding.</p>

<p>Gabriel slowly slid his hand under Mr. Hamlin's helpless
back, and under pretext of arranging his bandages, lifted
him in his arms like a truculent babe. "Jack," he said,
softly, "ef thet picter of yours&mdash;that coloured woman"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Which?" said Jack, fiercely.</p>

<p>"I mean&mdash;thet purty creature&mdash;ef she and you hed been
married, and you'd found out accidental like that she'd
fooled ye&mdash;more belike, Jack," he added, hastily, "o' your
own foolishness&mdash;than her little game&mdash;and"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>That</i> woman was a lady," interrupted Jack, savagely,
"and your wife's a"&mdash;&mdash;But he paused, looking into
Gabriel's face, and then added, "Oh git! will you! Leave
me alone! 'I want to be an angel and with the angels
stand.'"</p>

<p>"And thet woman hez a secret," continued Gabriel, unmindful
of the interruption, "and bein' hounded by the
man az knows it, up and kills him, ye wouldn't let thet
woman&mdash;that poor pooty creeture&mdash;suffer for it! No, Jack!
Ye would rather pint your own toes up to the sky than do
it. It ain't in ye, Jack, and it ain't in me, so help me, God!"</p>

<p>"This is all very touching, Mr. Conroy, and does credit,
sir, to your head and heart, and I kin feel it drawing Hall's
ball out of my leg while you're talkin'," said Jack, with his
black eyes evading Gabriel's and wandering to the entrance
of the tunnel. "What time is it, you d&mdash;d old fool, ain't it
dark enough yet to git outer this hole?" He groaned, and
after a pause added fiercely, "How do you know your wife
did it?"</p>

<p>Gabriel swiftly, and for him even concisely, related the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
events of the day from his meeting with Ramirez in the
morning, to the time that he had stumbled upon the body
of Victor Ramirez on his return to keep the appointment
at his wife's written request.</p>

<p>Jack only interrupted him once to inquire why, after discovering
the murder, he had not gone on to keep his appointment.</p>

<p>"I thought it wa'n't of no use," said Gabriel, simply; "I
didn't want to let her see I knowed it."</p>

<p>Hamlin groaned, "If you had you would have found her
in the company of the man who <i>did</i> do it, you daddering
old idiot!"</p>

<p>"What man?" asked Gabriel.</p>

<p>"The first man you saw your wife with that morning;
the man I ought to be helping now, instead of lyin' here."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to allow, Jack, ez you reckon she <i>didn't</i>
do it?" asked Gabriel, in alarm.</p>

<p>"I do," said Hamlin, coolly.</p>

<p>"Then what did she reckon to let on by that note?"
said Gabriel, with a sudden look of cunning.</p>

<p>"Don't know," returned Jack, "like as not, being a d&mdash;d
fool, you didn't read it right! hand it over and let me see
it."</p>

<p>Gabriel (hesitatingly): "I can't."</p>

<p>Hamlin: "You can't?"</p>

<p>Gabriel (apologetically): "I tore it up!"</p>

<p>Hamlin (with frightful deliberation): "you <span class="smcap">DID</span>?"'</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>Jack (after a long crushing silence): "Were you ever
under medical treatment for these spells?"</p>

<p>Gabriel (with great simplicity and submission): "They
allers used to allow I waz queer."</p>

<p>Hamlin (after another pause): "Has Pete Dumphy got
anything agin you?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span></p>

<p>Gabriel (surprisedly): "No."</p>

<p>Hamlin (languidly): "It was his right hand man, his
agent at Wingdam that started up the Vigilantes! I heard
him, and saw him in the crowd hounding 'em on."</p>

<p>Gabriel (simply): "I reckon you're out thar, Jack,
Dumphy's my friend. It was him that first gin me the
money to open this yer mine. And I'm his superintendent!"</p>

<p>Jack: "Oh!" (after another pause). "Is there any first-class
Lunatic Asylum in this county where they would
take in two men, one an incurable, and the other sufferin'
from a gunshot wound brought on by playin' with firearms?"</p>

<p>Gabriel (with a deep sigh): "Ye mus'n't talk, Jack, ye
must be quiet till dark."</p>

<p>Jack, dragged down by pain, and exhausted in the
intervals of each paroxysm was quiescent.</p>

<p>Gradually, the faint light that had filtered through the
brush and débris before the tunnel faded quite away, and a
damp charnel-house chill struck through the limbs of the
two refugees, and made them shiver; the flow of water
from the dripping walls seemed to have increased;
Gabriel's experienced eye had already noted that the earthquake
had apparently opened seams in the gully and
closed up one of the leads. He carefully laid his burden
down again, and crept to the opening. The distant hum
of voices and occupation had ceased, the sun was setting;
in a few moments, calculating on the brief twilight of the
Mountain region, it would be dark, and they might with
safety leave their hiding-place. As he was returning, he
noticed a slant beam of light, hitherto unobserved, crossing
the tunnel from an old drift. Examining it more closely,
Gabriel was amazed to find that during the earthquake a
"cave" had taken place in the drift, possibly precipitated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
by the shock, disclosing the more surprising fact that there
had been a previous slight but positive excavation on the
hill side, above the tunnel, that antedated any record of
One Horse Gulch known to Gabriel. He was perfectly
familiar with every foot of the hill side, and the existence
of this ancient prospecting "hole" had never been even
suspected by him. While he was still gazing at the
opening, his foot struck against some glittering metallic
substance. He stooped and picked up a small tin can, not
larger than a sardine box, hermetically sealed and soldered,
in which some inscription had been traced, but which the
darkness of the tunnel prevented his deciphering. In the
faint hope that it might contain something of benefit to his
companion, Gabriel returned to the opening, and even
ventured to step beyond its shadow. But all attempts to
read the inscription were in vain. He opened the box
with a sharp stone; it contained, to his great disappointment,
only a memorandum book and some papers. He
swept them into the pocket of his blouse, and re-entered
the tunnel. He had not been absent altogether more than
five minutes, but when he reached the place where he had
left Jack, he was gone!</p>

<h4>CHAPTER IX.</h4>

<h5>IN WHICH HECTOR ARISES FROM THE DITCH.</h5>


<p>He stood for a moment breathless and paralysed with
surprise; then he began slowly and deliberately to examine
the tunnel step by step. When he had proceeded a
hundred feet from the spot, to his great relief he came
upon Jack Hamlin, sitting upright in a side drift. His
manner was feverish and excited, and his declaration that
he had not moved from the place where Gabriel had left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
him at once was accepted by the latter as the aberration of
incipient inflammation and fever. When Gabriel stated
that it was time to go, he replied, "Yes," and added with
such significance that his business with the murderer of
Victor Ramirez was now over, and that he was ready to
enter the Lunatic Asylum at once, that Gabriel with
great precipitation lifted him in his arms and carried him
without delay from the tunnel. Once more in the open air
the energies of both men seemed to rally; Jack became as
a mere feather in Gabriel's powerful arms, and even forgot
his querulous opposition to being treated as a helpless
child, while Gabriel trod the familiar banks of the ditch,
climbed the long ascent and threaded the aisles of the
pillared pines of Reservoir Hill with the free experienced
feet of the mountaineer. Here Gabriel knew he was safe
until daybreak, and gathered together some withered pine
boughs and its fragrant tassels for a couch for his helpless
companion. And here, as he feared, fever set in; the
respiration of the wounded man grew quick and hurried;
he began to talk rapidly and incoherently, of Olly, of
Ramirez, of the beautiful girl whose picture hung upon his
breast, of Gabriel himself, and finally of a stranger who
was, as it seemed to him, his sole auditor, the gratuitous
coinage of his excited fancy. Once or twice he raised his
voice to a shout, and then to Gabriel's great alarm suddenly
he began to sing, and before Gabriel could place his hand
upon his mouth he had trolled out the verse of a popular
ballad. The rushing river below them gurgled, beat its
bars, and sang an accompaniment, the swaying pine sighed
and creaked in unison, the patient stars above them stared
and bent breathlessly, and then to Gabriel's exalted consciousness
an echo of the wounded man's song arose from
the gulch below! For a moment he held his breath with
an awful mingling of joy and fear. Was he going mad too?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
or was it really the voice of little Olly? The delirious man
beside him answered his query with another verse; the
antiphonal response rose again from the valley. Gabriel
hesitated no longer, but with feverish hands gathered a few
dried twigs and pine cones into a pile, and touched a
match to them. At the next moment they flashed a beacon
to the sky, in another there was a crackling of the underbrush
and the hurried onset of two figures, and before the
slow Gabriel could recover from his astonishment, Olly
flew, panting, to his arms, while her companion, the faithful
Pete, sank breathlessly beside his wounded and insensible
master.</p>

<p>Olly was first to find her speech. That speech, after the
unfailing instincts of her sex in moments of excitement,
was the instant arraignment of somebody else as the cause
of that excitement, and at once put the whole universe on
the defensive.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you send word where you was?" she said,
impatiently, "and wot did you have it so dark for, and up
a steep hill, and leavin' me alone at Wingdam, and why
didn't you call without singin'?"</p>

<p>And then Gabriel, after the fashion of <i>his</i> sex, ignored
all but the present, and holding Olly in his arms, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's my little girl, ain't it? Come to her own brother
Gabe! bless her!"</p>

<p>Whereat Mr. Hamlin, after the fashion of lunatics of any
sex, must needs be consistent, and break out again into
song.</p>

<p>"He's looney, Olly, what with fever along o' bein' shot in
the leg a' savin' me, ez izn't worth savin'," explained
Gabriel, apologetically. "It was him ez did the singin'."</p>

<p>Then Olly, still following the feminine instinct, at once
deserted conscious rectitude for indefensible error, and flew
to Mr. Hamlin's side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, where is he hurt, Pete? is he going to die?"</p>

<p>And Pete, suspicious of any medication but his own,
replied doubtfully, "He looks bad, Miss Olly, dat's a fac&mdash;but
now bein' in my han's, bress de Lord A'mighty, and we
able to minister to him, we hopes fur de bess. Your
brudder meant well, is a fair meanin' man, miss&mdash;a toll'able
nuss, but he ain't got the peerfeshn'l knowledge dat Mars
Jack in de habit o' gettin'." Here Pete unslung from his
shoulders a wallet, and proceeded to extract therefrom a
small medicine case, with the resigned air of the family
physician, who has been called full late to remedy the
practice of rustic empiricism.</p>

<p>"How did ye come yer?" asked Gabriel of Olly, when
he had submissively transferred his wounded charge to
Pete. "What made ye allow I was hidin' yer? How did
ye reckon to find me? but ye was allus peart and
onhanded, Olly," he suggested, gazing admiringly at his
sister.</p>

<p>"When I woke up at Wingdam, after Jack went away,
who should I find, Gabe, but Lawyer Maxwell standin'
thar, and askin' me a heap o' questions. I supposed you'd
been makin' a fool o' yourself agin, Gabe, and afore I let
on thet I knowed a word, I jist made him tell me everythin'
about you, Gabe, and it was orful! and you bein'
arrested fur murder, ez wouldn't harm a fly, let alone that
Mexican ez I never liked, Gabe, and all this comes of
tendin' his legs instead o' lookin' arter me. And all them
questions waz about July, and whether she wasn't your
enemy, and if they ever waz a woman, Gabe, ez waz sweet
on you, you know it was July! And all thet kind o'
foolishness! And then when he couldn't get ennythin' out
o' me agin July, he allowed to Pete that he must take me
right to you, fur he said ther was talk o' the Vigilantes
gettin' hold o' ye afore the trial, and he was goin' to get an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
order to take you outer the county, and he reckoned they
wouldn't dare to tech ye if I waz with ye, Gabe&mdash;and I'd
like to see 'em try it! and he allowed to Pete that he must
take me right to you! And Pete&mdash;and thar ain't a whiter
nigger livin' than that ole man&mdash;said he would&mdash;reckonin'
you know to find Jack, as he allowed to me they'd hev to
kill afore they got you&mdash;and he came down yer with me.
And when we got yer&mdash;you was off&mdash;and the sheriff gone&mdash;and
the Vigilantes&mdash;what with bein' killed, the biggest
o' them, by the earthquake&mdash;what was orful, Gabe, but we
bein' on the road didn't get to feel!&mdash;jest scared outer their
butes! And then a Chinyman gins us your note"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"My note?" interrupted Gabriel, "I didn't send ye any
note."</p>

<p>"Then <i>his</i> note," said Olly, impatiently, pointing to
Hamlin, "sayin' 'You'll find your friends on Conroy's
Hill!'&mdash;don't you see, Gabe?" continued Olly, stamping
her foot in fury at her brother's slowness of comprehension,
"and so we came and heard Jack singin', and a mighty
foolish thing it was to do, and yer we are!"</p>

<p>"But he didn't send any note, Olly," persisted Gabriel.</p>

<p>"Well, you awful old Gabe, what difference does it
make <i>who</i> sent it?" continued the practical Olly; "here
we are, along o' thet note, and," she added, feeling in her
pocket, "there's the note!"</p>

<p>She handed Gabriel a small slip of paper with the
pencilled words, "You'll find your friends waiting for you
to-night on Conroy's Hill."</p>

<p>The handwriting was unfamiliar, but even if it were
Jack's, how did <i>he</i> manage to send it without his knowledge?
He had not lost sight of Jack except during the
few moments he had reconnoitred the mouth of the tunnel,
since they had escaped from the Court House. Gabriel
was perplexed; in the presence of this anonymous note he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
was confused and speechless, and could only pass his hand
helplessly across his forehead. "But it's all right now,
Gabe," continued Olly, reassuringly, "the Vigilantes hev
run away&mdash;what was left of them; the sheriff ain't to be
found nowhar! This yer earthquake hez frightened everybody
outer the idea of huntin' ye&mdash;nobody talks of ennything
but the earthquake; they even say, Gabe&mdash;I forgot
to tell ye&mdash;that our claim on Conroy Hill has busted, too,
and the mine ain't worth shucks now! But there's no one
to interfere with us now, Gabe! And we're goin' to get
into a waggin that Pete hez bespoke for us at the head of
Reservoir Gulch to-morrow mornin' at sun-up! And then
Pete sez we kin git down to Stockton and 'Frisco and out
to a place called San Antonio, that the devil himself
wouldn't think o' goin' to, and thar we kin stay, me and
you and Jack, until this whole thing has blown over and
Jack gits well agin and July comes back."</p>

<p>Gabriel, still holding the hand of his sister, dared not
tell her of the suspicions of Lawyer Maxwell, regarding her
sister-in-law's complicity in this murder, nor Jack's conviction
of her infidelity, and he hesitated. But after a pause,
he suggested with a consciousness of great discretion and
artfulness, "Suppose thet July doesn't come back?"</p>

<p>"Look yer, Gabe," said Olly, suddenly, "ef yer goin' to
be thet foolish and ridiklus agin, I'll jess quit. Ez if thet
woman would ever leave ye." (Gabriel groaned inwardly.)
"Why, when she hears o' this, wild hosses couldn't keep
her from ye. Don't be a mule, Gabe, don't!" And
Gabriel was dumb.</p>

<p>Meantime, under the influence of some anodyne which
Pete had found in his medicine chest, Mr. Hamlin became
quiet and pretermitted his vocal obligato. Gabriel, whose
superb physical adjustment no mental excitement could
possibly overthrow, and whose regular habits were never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
broken by anxiety, nodded, even while holding Olly's hand,
and in due time slept, and I regret to say&mdash;writing of a
hero&mdash;snored. After a while Olly herself succumbed to
the drowsy coolness of the night, and wrapped in Mr.
Hamlin's shawl, pillowed her head upon her brother's
broad breast and slept too. Only Pete remained to keep
the watch, he being comparatively fresh and strong, and
declaring that the condition of Mr. Hamlin required his
constant attention.</p>

<p>It was after midnight that Olly dreamed a troubled dream.
She thought that she was riding with Mr. Hamlin to seek
her brother, when she suddenly came upon a crowd of
excited men who were bearing Gabriel to the gallows. She
thought that she turned to Mr. Hamlin frantically for
assistance, when she saw to her horror that his face had
changed&mdash;that it was no longer he who sat beside her, but
a strange, wild-looking, haggard man&mdash;a man whose face
was old and pinched, but whose grey hair was discoloured
by a faded dye that had worn away, leaving the original
colour in patches, and the antique foppery of whose dress
was deranged by violent exertion, and grimy with the dust
of travel&mdash;a dandy whose strapped trousers of a bygone
fashion were ridiculously loosened in one leg, whose high
stock was unbuckled and awry! She awoke with a start.
Even then her dream was so vivid that it seemed to her this
face was actually bending over her with such a pathetic
earnestness and inquiry that she called aloud. It was some
minutes before Pete came to her, but as he averred, albeit
somewhat incoherently and rubbing his eyes to show that
he had not closed them, that he had never slept a wink,
and that it was impossible for any stranger to have come
upon them without his knowledge, Olly was obliged to
accept it all as a dream! But she did not sleep again.
She watched the moon slowly sink behind the serrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
pines of Conroy's Hill; she listened to the crackling tread
of strange animals in the underbrush, to the far-off rattle of
wheels on the Wingdam turnpike, until the dark outline of
the tree trunks returned, and with the cold fires of the mountain
sunrise the chilly tree-tops awoke to winged life, and the
twitter of birds, while the faint mists of the river lingered
with the paling moon like tired sentinels for the relief of
the coming day. And then Olly awoke her companions.
They struggled back into consciousness with characteristic
expression. Gabriel slowly and apologetically, as of one
who had overslept himself; Jack Hamlin violently and
aggressively, as if some unfair advantage had been taken
of his human weakness that it was necessary to combat at
once. I am sorry to say that his recognition of Pete was
accompanied by a degree of profanity and irreverence that
was dangerous to his own physical weakness. "And you
had to trapse down yer, sniffin' about my tracks, you black
and tan idiot," continued Mr. Hamlin, raising himself on
his arm, "and after I'd left everything all straight at
Wingdam&mdash;and jest as I was beginning to reform and lead
a new life! How do, Olly? You'll excuse my not rising.
Come and kiss me! If that nigger of mine has let you
want for anything, jest tell me and I'll discharge him.
Well! hang it all! what are you waitin' for? Here it's
daybreak and we've got to get down to the head of
Reservoir Gulch. Come, little children, the picnic is
over!"</p>

<p>Thus adjured, Gabriel rose, and lifting Mr. Hamlin in
his arms with infinite care and tenderness, headed the
quaint procession. Mr. Hamlin, perhaps recognising some
absurdity in the situation, forbore exercising his querulous
profanity on the man who held him helpless as an infant,
and Olly and Pete followed slowly behind.</p>

<p>Their way led down Reservoir Cañon, beautiful, hopeful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
and bracing in the early morning air. A few birds,
awakened by the passing tread, started into song a
moment, and then were still. With a cautious gentleness,
habitual to the man, Gabriel forbore, as he strode along,
to step upon the few woodland blossoms yet left to the dry
summer woods. There was a strange fragrance in the air,
the light odours liberated from a thousand nameless herbs,
the faint melancholy spicing of dead leaves. There was,
moreover, that sense of novelty which Nature always brings
with the dawn in deep forests; a fancy that during the night
the earth had been created anew, and was fresh from the
Maker's hand, as yet untried by burden or tribulation, and
guiltless of a Past. And so it seemed to the little caravan&mdash;albeit
fleeing from danger and death&mdash;that yesterday and
its fears were far away, or had, in some unaccountable way,
shrunk behind them in the west with the swiftly dwindling
night. Olly once or twice strayed from the trail to pick
an opening flower or lingering berry; Pete hummed to
himself the fragment of an old camp-meeting song.</p>

<p>And so they walked on, keeping the rosy dawn and its
promise before them. From time to time the sound of far-off
voices came to them faintly. Slowly the light quickened;
morning stole down the hills upon them stealthily, and at
last the entrance of the cañon became dimly outlined. Olly
uttered a shout and pointed to a black object moving
backward and forward before the opening. It was the
waggon and team awaiting them. Olly's shout was answered
by a whistle from the driver, and they quickened their pace
joyfully; in another moment they would be beyond the
reach of danger.</p>

<p>Suddenly a voice that seemed to start from the ground
before them called on Gabriel to stop! He did so unconsciously,
drawing Hamlin closer to him with one hand, and
with the other making a broad protecting sweep toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
Olly. And then a figure rose slowly from the ditch at the
roadside and barred their passage.</p>

<p>It was only a single man! A small man bespattered
with the slime of the ditch and torn with brambles; a man
exhausted with fatigue and tremulous with nervous excitement,
but still erect and threatening. A man whom Gabriel
and Hamlin instantly recognised, even through his rags and
exhaustion! It was Joe Hall&mdash;the sheriff of Calaveras!
He held a pistol in his right hand, even while his left
exhaustedly sought the support of a tree! By a common
instinct both men saw that while the hand was feeble the
muzzle of the weapon covered them.</p>

<p>"Gabriel Conroy, I want you," said the apparition.</p>

<p>"He's got us lined! Drop me," whispered Hamlin,
hastily, "drop me! I'll spoil his aim."</p>

<p>But Gabriel, by a swift, dexterous movement that seemed
incompatible with his usual deliberation, instantly transferred
Hamlin to his other arm, and with his burden completely
shielded, presented his own right shoulder squarely to the
muzzle of Hall's revolver.</p>

<p>"Gabriel Conroy, you are my prisoner," repeated the
voice.</p>

<p>Gabriel did not move. But over his shoulder as a rest,
dropped the long shining barrel of Jack's own favourite
duelling pistol, and over it glanced the bright eye of its
crippled owner. The issue was joined!</p>

<p>There was a deathlike silence.</p>

<p>"Go on!" said Jack, quietly. "Keep cool, Joe. For
if <i>you</i> miss him, you're gone in; and hit or miss <i>I've</i> got
<i>you</i> sure!"</p>

<p>The barrel of Hall's pistol wavered a moment, from
physical weakness but not from fear. The great heart
behind it, though broken, was undaunted.</p>

<p>"It's all right," said the voice fatefully. "It's all right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
Jack! Ye'll kill me, I know! But ye can't help sayin'
arter all that I did my duty to Calaveras as the sheriff, and
'specially to them twenty-five men ez elected me over
Boggs! I ain't goin' to let ye pass. I've been on this yer
hunt, up and down this cañon all night. Hevin' no possy
I reckon I've got to die yer in my tracks. All right! But
ye'll git into thet waggon over my dead body, Jack&mdash;over
my dead body, sure."</p>

<p>Even as he spoke these words he straightened himself to
his full height&mdash;which was not much, I fear&mdash;and steadied
himself by the tree, his weapon still advanced and pointing
at Gabriel, but with such an evident and hopeless contrast
between his determination and his evident inability to
execute it, that his attitude impressed his audience less
with its heroism than its half-pathetic absurdity.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamlin laughed. But even then he suddenly felt
the grasp of Gabriel relax, found himself slipping to his
companion's feet, and the next moment was deposited carefully
but ignominiously on the ground by Gabriel, who
strode quietly and composedly up to the muzzle of the
sheriff's pistol.</p>

<p>"I am ready to go with ye, Mr. Hall," he said, gently,
putting the pistol aside with a certain large indifferent wave
of the hand, "ready to go with ye&mdash;now&mdash;at onct! But
I've one little favour to ax ye. This yer pore young man,
ez yur wounded, unbeknownst," he said, pointing to Hamlin,
who was writhing and gritting his teeth in helpless rage and
fury, "ez not to be tuk with me, nor for me! Thar ain't
nothin' to be done to him. He hez been dragged inter this
fight. But I'm ready to go with ye now, Mr. Hall, and am
sorry you got into the troubil along o' me."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span></p>

<h2>BOOK VII.</h2>

<h3><i>THE BED ROCK.</i></h3>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

<h5>IN THE TRACK OF A STORM.</h5>


<p>A quarter of an hour before the messenger of Peter
Dumphy had reached Poinsett's office, Mr. Poinsett had
received a more urgent message. A telegraph despatched
from San Antonio had been put into his hands. Its few
curt words, more significant to an imaginative man than
rhetorical expression, ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Mission Church destroyed. Father Felipe safe. Blessed Trinity
in ruins and Dolores missing. My house spared. Come at once.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Maria
Sepulvida.</span>"</p></blockquote>

<p>The following afternoon at four o'clock Arthur Poinsett
reached San Geronimo, within fifteen miles of his destination.
Here the despatch was confirmed with some slight
local exaggeration.</p>

<p>"Saints and devils! There is no longer a St. Anthony!
The <i>temblor</i> has swallowed him!" said the innkeeper,
sententiously. "It is the end of all! Such is the world.
Thou wilt find stones on stones instead of houses, Don
Arturo. Wherefore another glass of the brandy of France,
or the whisky of the American, as thou dost prefer. But
of San Antonio&mdash;nothing!&mdash;Absolutely&mdash;perfectly&mdash;truly
nothing!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of this cheering prophecy, Mr. Poinsett did not
wait for the slow diligence, but mounting a fleet mustang
dashed off in quest of the missing Mission. He was somewhat
relieved at the end of an hour by the far-off flash of
the sea, the rising of the dark green fringe of the Mission
orchard and <i>Encinal</i>, and above it the white dome of one
of the Mission towers. But at the next moment Arthur
checked his horse and rubbed his eyes in wonder. Where
was the other tower? He put spurs to his horse again and
dashed off at another angle, and again stopped and gazed.
<i>There was but one tower remaining.</i> The Mission Church
must have been destroyed!</p>

<p>Perhaps it was this discovery, perhaps it was some
instinct stronger than this; but when Arthur had satisfied
himself of this fact he left the direct road, which would
have brought him to the Mission, and diverged upon the
open plain towards the Rancho of the Blessed Trinity. A
fierce wind from the sea swept the broad <i>llano</i> and seemed
to oppose him, step by step&mdash;a wind so persistent and
gratuitous that it appeared to Arthur to possess a moral
quality, and as such was to be resisted and overcome by
his superior will. Here, at least, all was unchanged; here
was the dead, flat monotony of land and sky. Here was
the brittle, harsh stubble of the summer fields, sun-baked
and wind-dried; here were the long stretches of silence,
from which even the harrying wind made no opposition nor
complaint; here were the formless specks of slowly-moving
cattle, even as he remembered them before. A momentary
chill came over him as he recalled his own perilous
experience on these plains, a momentary glow suffused his
cheek as he thought of his rescue by the lovely but cold
recluse. Again he heard the name of "Philip" softly
whispered in his ears, again he felt the flood of old
memories sweep over him as he rode, even as he had felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
them when he lay that day panting upon the earth. And
yet Arthur had long since convinced his mind that he was
mistaken in supposing that Donna Dolores had addressed
him at that extreme moment as "Philip;" he had long
since believed it was a trick of his disordered and exhausted
brain; the conduct of Dolores towards himself,
habitually restrained by grave courtesy, never justified him
in directly asking the question, nor suggested any
familiarity that might have made it probable. She had
never alluded to it again&mdash;but had apparently forgotten it.
Not so Arthur! He had often gone over that memorable
scene, with a strange, tormenting pleasure that was almost
a pain. It was the one incident of his life, for whose
poetry he was not immediately responsible&mdash;the one
genuine heart-thrill whose sincerity he had not afterwards
stopped to question in his critical fashion, the one enjoyment
that had not afterwards appeared mean and delusive.
And now the heroine of this episode was missing, and he
might never perhaps see her again! And yet when he first
heard the news he was conscious of a strange sense of
relief&mdash;rather let me say of an awakening from a dream,
that though delicious, had become dangerous and might
unfit him for the practical duties of his life. Donna
Dolores had never affected him as a real personage&mdash;at
least the interest he felt in her was, he had always considered,
due to her relations to some romantic condition
of his mind, and her final disappearance from the plane of
his mental vision was only the exit of an actress from the
mimic stage. It seemed only natural that she should
disappear as mysteriously as she came. There was no
shock even to the instincts of his ordinary humanity&mdash;it
was no catastrophe involving loss of life or even suffering
to the subject or spectator.</p>

<p>Such at least was Mr. Poinsett's analysis of his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
mental condition on the receipt of Donna Maria's telegram.
It was the cool self-examination of a man who believed
himself cold-blooded and selfish, superior to the weakness
of ordinary humanity, and yet was conscious of neither
pride nor disgrace in the belief. Yet when he diverged
from his direct road to the Mission, and turned his horse's
head toward the home of Donna Dolores, he was conscious
of a new impulse and anxiety that was stronger than his
reason. Unable as he was to resist it, he still took some
satisfaction in believing that it was nearly akin to that
feeling which years before had driven him back to Starvation
Camp in quest of the survivors. Suddenly his horse
recoiled with a bound that would have unseated a less skilful
rider. Directly across his path stretched a chasm in
the level plain&mdash;thirty feet broad and as many feet in
depth, and at its bottom in undistinguishable confusion lay
the wreck of the corral of the Blessed Trinity!</p>

<p>Except for the enormous size and depth of this fissure
Arthur might have mistaken it for the characteristic cracks
in the sunburnt plain, which the long dry summer had
wrought upon its surface, some of which were so broad as
to task the agility of his horse. But a second glance convinced
him of the different character of the phenomenon.
The earth had not cracked asunder nor separated, but had
sunk. The width of the chasm below was nearly equal to
the width above; the floor of this valley in miniature was
carpeted by the same dry, brittle herbs and grasses which
grew upon the plain around him.</p>

<p>In the pre-occupation of the last hour he had forgotten
the distance he had traversed. He had evidently ridden
faster than he had imagined. But if this was really the
corral, the walls of the Rancho should now be in sight at
the base of the mountain! He turned in that direction.
Nothing was to be seen! Only the monotonous plain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
stretched before him, vast and unbroken. Between the
chasm where he stood and the <i>falda</i> of the first low foot-hills
neither roof nor wall nor ruin rose above the dull,
dead level!</p>

<p>An ominous chill ran through his veins, and for an
instant the reins slipped through his relaxed fingers. Good
God! Could this have been what Donna Maria meant, or
had there been a later convulsion of Nature? He looked
around him. The vast, far-stretching plain, desolate and
trackless as the shining ocean beyond, took upon itself an
awful likeness to that element! Standing on the brink of
the revealed treachery of that yawning chasm, Arthur
Poinsett read the fate of the Rancho. In the storm that
had stirred the depths of this motionless level, the Rancho
and its miserable inmates had <i>foundered</i> and gone down!</p>

<p>Arthur's first impulse was to push on towards the scene
of the disaster, in the vague hope of rendering some
service. But the chasm before him was impassable, and
seemed to continue to the sea beyond. Then he reflected
that the catastrophe briefly told in Donna Maria's despatch
had happened twenty-four hours before, and help was perhaps
useless now. He cursed the insane impulse that had
brought him here, aimlessly and without guidance, and left
him powerless even to reach the object of his quest. If he
had only gone first to the Mission, asked the advice and
assistance of Father Felipe, or learned at least the full
details of the disaster! He uttered an oath, rare to his
usual calm expression, and wheeling his horse, galloped
fiercely back towards the Mission.</p>

<p>Night had deepened over the plain. With the going
down of the sun a fog that had been stealthily encompassing
the coast-line stole with soft step across the shining
beach, dulled its lustre, and then moved slowly and
solemnly upon the plain, blotting out the Point of Pines, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
first salient with its sparkling Lighthouse, but now undistinguishable
from the grey sea above and below, until it
reached the galloping horse and its rider, and then, as it
seemed to Arthur, isolated them from the rest of the world&mdash;from
even the pencilled outlines of the distant foot-hills,
that it at last sponged from the blue-grey slate before him.
At times the far-off tolling of a fog-bell came faintly to his
ear, but all sound seemed to be blotted out by the fog;
even the rapid fall of his horse's hoofs was muffled and
indistinct. By degrees the impression that he was riding in
a dream overcame him, and was accepted by him without
questioning or deliberation.</p>

<p>It seemed to be a consistent part of the dream or vision
when he rode&mdash;or rather as it seemed to him, was borne
by the fog&mdash;into the outlying fields and lanes of the
Mission. A few lights, with a nimbus of fog around them,
made the narrow street of the town appear still more
ghostly and unreal as he plunged through its obscurity
towards the plaza and church. Even by the dim grey light
he could see that one of the towers had fallen, and that the
eastern wing and Refectory were a mass of shapeless ruin.
And what would at another time have excited his surprise
now only struck him as a natural part of his dream,&mdash;the
church a blaze of light and filled with thronging worshippers!
Still possessed by his strange fancy, Arthur Poinsett
dismounted, led his horse beneath the shed beside the
remaining tower, and entered the building. The body and
nave of the church were intact; the outlandish paintings
still hung from the walls; the waxen effigies of the Blessed
Virgin and the saints still leaned from their niches, yellow
and lank, and at the high altar Father Felipe was officiating.
As he entered a dirge broke from the choir; he saw that
the altar and its offerings were draped in black, and in the
first words uttered by the priest Arthur recognised the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
mass for the dead! The feverish impatience that had
filled his breast and heightened the colour of his cheeks for
the last hour was gone. He sunk upon a bench beside
one of the worshippers and buried his face in his hands.
The voice of the organ rose again faintly; the quaint-voiced
choir awoke, the fumes of incense filled the church,
and the monotonous accents of the priest fell soothingly
upon his ear, and Arthur seemed to sleep. I say seemed
to sleep, for ten minutes later he came to himself with a
start as if awakening from a troubled dream, with the voice
of Padre Felipe in his ear, and the soft, caressing touch of
Padre Felipe on his shoulder. The worshippers had dispersed,
the church was dark save a few candles still
burning on the high altar, and for an instant he could not
recall himself.</p>

<p>"I knew you would come, son," said Padre Felipe;
"but where is she? Did you bring her with you?"</p>

<p>"Who?" asked Arthur, striving to recall his scattered
senses.</p>

<p>"Who? Saints preserve us, Don Arturo! She who
sent for you&mdash;Donna Maria! Did you not get her
message?"</p>

<p>Arthur replied that he had only just arrived, and had at
once hastened to the Mission. For some reason that he
was ashamed to confess he did not say that he had tried to
reach the Rancho of the Blessed Trinity, nor did he admit
that he had forgotten for the last two hours even the existence
of Donna Maria. "You were having a mass for the
dead, Father Felipe?&mdash;you have then suffered here?"</p>

<p>He paused anxiously, for in his then confused state of
mind he doubted how much of his late consciousness had
been real or visionary.</p>

<p>"Mother of God," said Father Felipe, eyeing Arthur
curiously. "You know not then for whom was this mass?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
You know not that a saint has gone&mdash;that Donna Dolores
has at last met her reward?"</p>

<p>"I have heard&mdash;that is, Donna Maria's despatch said&mdash;that
she was missing," stammered Arthur, feeling, with a
new and unsupportable disbelief in himself, that his face
was very pale and his voice uncertain.</p>

<p>"Missing!" echoed Father Felipe, with the least trace
of impatience in his voice. "Missing! She will be found
when the Rancho of the Blessed Trinity is restored&mdash;when
the ruins of the <i>casa</i>, sunk fifty feet below the surface,
are brought again to the level of the plain. Missing,
Don Arturo!&mdash;ah!&mdash;missing indeed!&mdash;for ever! always,
entirely!"</p>

<p>Moved perhaps by something in Arthur's face, Padre
Felipe sketched in a few graphic pictures the details of the
catastrophe already forecast by Arthur. It was a repetition
of the story of the sunken corral. The earthquake had not
only levelled the walls of the Rancho of the Blessed Trinity,
but had opened a grave-like chasm fifty feet below it, and
none had escaped to tell the tale. The faithful <i>vaqueros</i>
had rushed from the trembling and undulating plain to the
Rancho, only to see it topple into a yawning abyss that
opened to receive it. Don Juan, Donna Dolores, the
faithful Manuela, and Alejandro, the <i>major domo</i>, with a
dozen peons and retainers, went down with the crumbling
walls. No one had escaped. Was it not possible to dig
in the ruins for the bodies? Mother of God! had not
Don Arturo been told that the earth at the second shock
had closed over the sunken ruins, burying beyond mortal
resurrection all that the Rancho contained? They were
digging, but hopelessly&mdash;a dozen men. They might&mdash;weeks
hence&mdash;discover the bodies&mdash;but who knows?</p>

<p>The meek, fatalistic way that Father Felipe accepted the
final doom of Donna Dolores exasperated Arthur beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
bounds. In San Francisco a hundred men would have
been digging night and day in the mere chance of recovering
the buried family. Here&mdash;but Arthur remembered the
sluggish, helpless retainers of Salvatierra, the dreadful
fatalism which affected them on the occurrence of this mysterious
catastrophe, even as shown in the man before him,
their accepted guide and leader&mdash;and shuddered. Could
anything be done? Could he not, with Dumphy's assistance,
procure a gang of men from San Francisco? And
then came the instinct of caution, always powerful with a
nature like Arthur's. If these people, most concerned in
the loss of their friends, their relations, accepted it so hopelessly,
what right had he&mdash;a mere stranger&mdash;to interfere?</p>

<p>"But come, my son," said Padre Felipe, laying his large
soft hand, parentally, on Arthur's shoulder. "Come, come
with me to my rooms. Thanks to the Blessed Virgin I
have still shelter and a roof to offer you. Ah!" he added,
stroking Arthur's riding-coat, and examining critically as if
he had been a large child, "what have we&mdash;what is this,
eh? You are wet with this heretic fog&mdash;eh? Your hands
are cold, and your cheeks hot. You have fatigue! Possibly&mdash;most
possibly, hunger! No! No! It is so. Come
with me, come!" and drawing Arthur's passive arm through
his own, he opened the vestry door, and led him across the
little garden, choked with débris and plaster of the fallen
tower, to a small adobe building that had been the Mission
schoolroom. It was now hastily fitted up as Padre Felipe's
own private apartment and meditative cell. A bright fire
burned in the low, oven-like hearth. Around the walls
hung various texts illustrating the achievement of youthful
penmanship with profound religious instruction. At the
extremity of the room there was a small organ. Midway
and opposite the hearth was a deep embrasured window&mdash;the
window at which two weeks before, Mr. Jack Hamlin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
had beheld the Donna Dolores. "She spent much of her
time here, dear child, in the instruction of the young," said
Father Felipe, taking a huge pinch of snuff, and applying a
large red bandana handkerchief to his eyes and nose. "It
is her best monument! Thanks to her largess&mdash;and she
was ever free-handed, Don Arturo, to the Church&mdash;the
foundation of the Convent of our Lady of Sorrows, her
own patron saint, thou seest here. Thou knowest, possibly&mdash;most
possibly as her legal adviser&mdash;that long ago, by her
will, the whole of the Salvatierra Estate is a benefaction to
the Holy Church, eh?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't!" said Arthur, suddenly, awakening with
a glow of Protestant and heretical objection that was new
to him, and eyeing Padre Felipe with the first glance of
suspicion he had ever cast upon that venerable ecclesiastic.
"No, sir, I never heard any intimation or suggestion of the
kind from the late Donna Dolores. On the contrary, I
was engaged"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pardon&mdash;pardon me, my son," interrupted Father
Felipe, taking another large pinch of snuff. "It is not
now, scarce twenty-four hours since the dear child was
translated&mdash;not in her masses and while her virgin strewments
are not yet faded&mdash;that we will talk of this" (he
blew his nose violently). "No! All in good time&mdash;thou
shalt see! But I have something here," he continued,
turning over some letters and papers in his desk. "Something
for you&mdash;possibly, most possibly, more urgent. It is
a telegraphic despatch for you, to my care."</p>

<p>He handed a yellow envelope to Arthur. But Poinsett's
eyes were suddenly fixed upon a card which lay upon
Padre Felipe's table, and which the Padre's search for
the despatch had disclosed. Written across its face
was the name of Colonel Culpepper Starbottle of Siskiyou!
"Do you know that man?" asked Poinsett, holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
the despatch unopened in his hand, and pointing to the
card.</p>

<p>Father Felipe took another pinch of snuff. "Possibly&mdash;most
possibly! A lawyer, I think&mdash;I think! Some
business of the Church property! I have forgotten. But
your despatch, Don Arturo. What says it? It does not
take you from us? And you&mdash;only an hour here?"</p>

<p>Father Felipe paused, and looking up innocently, found
the eyes of Arthur regarding him gravely. The two men
examined each other intently. Arthur's eyes, at last, withdrew
from the clear, unshrinking glance of Padre Felipe,
unabashed but unsatisfied. A sudden recollection of the
thousand and one scandals against the Church, and wild
stories of its far-reaching influence&mdash;a swift remembrance of
the specious craft and cunning charged upon the religious
order of which Padre Felipe was a member&mdash;scandals that
he had hitherto laughed at as idle&mdash;flashed through his
mind. Conscious that he was now putting himself in a
guarded attitude before the man with whom he had always
been free and outspoken, Arthur, after a moment's embarrassment
that was new to him, turned for relief to the
despatch and opened it. In an instant it drove all other
thoughts from his mind. Its few words were from Dumphy
and ran, characteristically, as follows: "Gabriel Conroy
arrested for murder of Victor Ramirez. What do you
propose? Answer."</p>

<p>Arthur rose to his feet. "When does the up-stage pass
through San Geronimo?" he asked, hurriedly.</p>

<p>"At midnight!" returned Padre Felipe. "Surely, my son,
you do not intend"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"And it is now nine o'clock," continued Arthur, consulting
his watch. "Can you procure me a fresh horse? It is of
the greatest importance, Father," he added, recovering his
usual frankness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! it is urgent!&mdash;it is a matter"&mdash;&mdash;suggested the
Padre, gently.</p>

<p>"Of life and death!" responded Arthur gravely.</p>

<p>Father Felipe rang a bell and gave some directions to a
servant, while Arthur, seating himself at the table, wrote an
answer to the despatch. "I can trust you to send it as soon
as possible to the telegraph office," he said, handing it to
Father Felipe.</p>

<p>The Padre took it in his hand, but glanced anxiously at
Arthur. "And Donna Maria?" he said, hesitatingly;
"you have not seen her yet! Surely you will stop at the
Blessed Fisherman, if only for a moment, eh?"</p>

<p>Arthur drew his riding-coat and cape over his shoulders
with a mischievous smile. "I am afraid not, Father; I
shall trust to you to explain that I was recalled suddenly,
and that I had not time to call; knowing the fascinations
of your society, Father, she will not begrudge the few
moments I have spent with you."</p>

<p>Before Father Felipe could reply the servant entered with
the announcement that the horse was ready.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Father Felipe," said Arthur, pressing the
priest's hands warmly, with every trace of his former suspiciousness
gone. "Good night. A thousand thanks for
the horse. In speeding the parting guest," he added, gravely,
"you have perhaps done more for the health of my soul
than you imagine&mdash;good-night. <i>Adios!</i>"</p>

<p>With a light laugh in his ears, the vision of a graceful,
erect figure, waving a salute from a phantom steed, an inward
rush of the cold grey fog, and muffled clatter of hoofs
over the mouldy and mossy marbles in the churchyard,
Father Felipe parted from his guest. He uttered a characteristic
adjuration, took a pinch of snuff, and closing the
door, picked up the card of the gallant Colonel Starbottle
and tossed it into the fire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span></p>

<p>But the perplexities of the holy Father ceased not with
the night. At an early hour in the morning, Donna Maria
Sepulvida appeared before him at breakfast, suspicious, indignant,
and irate.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Father Felipe," she said, hastily, "did the Don
Arturo pass the night here?"</p>

<p>"Truly no, my daughter," answered the Padre, cautiously.
"He was here but for a little"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"And he went away when?" interrupted Donna Maria.</p>

<p>"At nine."</p>

<p>"And where?" continued Donna Maria, with a rising
colour.</p>

<p>"To San Francisco, my child; it was business of great
importance&mdash;but sit down, sit, little one! This impatience
is of the devil, daughter, you must calm yourself."</p>

<p>"And do you know, Father Felipe, that he went away
without coming <i>near me</i>?" continued Donna Maria, in a
higher key, scarcely heeding her ghostly confessor.</p>

<p>"Possibly, most possibly! But he received a despatch&mdash;it
was of the greatest importance."</p>

<p>"A despatch!" repeated Donna Maria, scornfully.
"Truly&mdash;from whom?"</p>

<p>"I know not, my child," said Father Felipe, gazing at the
pink cheeks, indignant eyes, and slightly swollen eyelids
of his visitor; "this impatience&mdash;this anger is most unseemly."</p>

<p>"Was it from Mr. Dumphy?" reiterated Donna Maria,
stamping her little foot.</p>

<p>Father Felipe drew back his chair. Through what
unhallowed spell had this woman&mdash;once the meekest and
humblest of wives&mdash;become the shrillest and most shrewest
of widows? Was she about to revenge herself on Arthur
for her long suffering with the late Don José? Father
Felipe pitied Arthur now and prospectively.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you going to tell me?" said Donna Maria, tremulously,
with alarming symptoms of hysteria.</p>

<p>"I believe it was from Mr. Dumphy," stammered Padre
Felipe. "At least the answer Don Arturo gave me to send
in reply&mdash;only these words, 'I will return at once'&mdash;was
addressed to Mr. Dumphy. But I know not what was the
message <i>he</i> received."</p>

<p>"You don't!" said Donna Maria, rising to her feet, with
white in her cheek, fire in her eyes, and a stridulous pitch
in her voice. "You don't! Well! I will tell you! It
was the same news that <i>this</i> brought." She took a telegraphic
despatch from her pocket and shook it in the face
of Father Felipe. "There! read it! That was the news
sent to him! That was the reason why he turned and ran
away like a coward as he is! That was the reason why he
never came near me, like a perjured traitor as he is! That
is the reason why he came to you with his fastidious airs and,
his supercilious smile&mdash;and his&mdash;his&mdash;Oh, how I <span class="smcap">HATE HIM</span>!
That is why!&mdash;read it! read it! Why don't you read it?"
(She had been gesticulating with it, waving it in the air
wildly, and evading every attempt of Father Felipe to take
it from her.) "Read it! Read it and see why! Read and
see that I am ruined!&mdash;a beggar&mdash;a cajoled and tricked
and deceived woman&mdash;between these two villains, Dumphy
and Mis&mdash;ter&mdash;Arthur&mdash;Poin&mdash;sett! Ah! Read it&mdash;or are
you a traitor too? You and Dolores and all"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She crumpled the paper in her hands, threw it on the
floor, whitened suddenly round the lips, and then followed
the paper as suddenly, at full length, in a nervous spasm at
Father Felipe's feet. Father Felipe gazed, first at the paper
and then at the rigid form of his friend. He was a man,
an old one&mdash;with some experience of the sex, and I
regret to say he picked up the <i>paper</i> first, and straightened <i>it</i>
out. It was a telegraphic despatch in the following words:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Sorry to say telegram just received that earthquake has dropped out
lead of Conroy Mine! Everything gone up! Can't make further advances
or sell stock.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dumphy.</span>"</p></blockquote>

<p>Father Felipe bent over Donna Maria and raised her in
his arms. "Poor little one!" he said. "But I don't
think Arthur knew it."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

<h5>THE YELLOW ENVELOPE.</h5>


<p>For once, by a cruel irony, the adverse reports regarding
the stability of the Conroy mine were true. A few stockholders
still clung to the belief that it was a fabrication to
depress the stock, but the fact as stated in Mr. Dumphy's
despatch to Donna Maria was in possession of the public.
The stock, fell to $35, to $30, to $10&mdash;to nothing! An
hour after the earthquake it was known in One Horse Gulch
that the "lead" had "dropped" suddenly, and that a veil
of granite of incalculable thickness had been upheaved between
the seekers and the treasure, now lost in the mysterious
depths below. The vein was gone! Where?&mdash;no
one could tell. There were various theories, more or less
learned: there was one party who believed in the "subsidence"
of the vein, another who believed in the "interposition"
of the granite, but all tending to the same conclusion&mdash;the
inaccessibility of the treasure. Science pointed with
stony finger to the evidence of previous phenomena of the
same character visible throughout the Gulch. But the grim
"I told you so" of Nature was, I fear, no more satisfactory
to the dwellers of One Horse Gulch than the ordinary
prophetic distrust of common humanity.</p>

<p>The news spread quickly and far. It overtook several
wandering Californians in Europe, and sent them to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
bankers with anxious faces; it paled the cheeks of one or
two guardians of orphan children, frightened several widows,
drove a confidential clerk into shameful exile, and struck
Mr. Raynor in Boston with such consternation, that people
for the first time suspected that he had backed his opinion
of the resources of California with capital. Throughout
the length and breadth of the Pacific slope it produced a
movement of aggression which the earthquake had hitherto
failed to cover. The probabilities of danger to life and
limb by a recurrence of the shock had been dismissed from
the public consideration, but this actual loss of characteristic
property awakened the gravest anxiety. If Nature claimed
the privilege of at any time withdrawing from that implied
contract under which so many of California's best citizens
had occupied and improved the country, it was high time
that something should be done. Thus spake an intelligent
and unfettered press. A few old residents talked of returning
to the East.</p>

<p>During this excitement Mr. Dumphy bore himself toward
the world generally with perfect self-confidence, and, if
anything, an increased aggressiveness. His customers
dared not talk of their losses before him, or exhibit a
stoicism unequal to his own.</p>

<p>"It's a bad business," he would say; "what do you
propose?" And as the one latent proposition in each
human breast was the return of the money invested, and as
no one dared to make that proposition, Mr. Dumphy was,
as usual, triumphant. In this frame of mind Mr. Poinsett
found him on his return from the Mission of San Antonio,
the next morning.</p>

<p>"Bad news, I suppose, down there," said Mr. Dumphy,
briskly; "and I reckon the widow, though she has been
luckier than her neighbours, don't feel particularly lively,
eh? I'm devilish sorry for you, Poinsett, though, as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
man, you can see that the investment was a good one.
But you can't make a woman understand business. Eh?
Well, the Rancho's worth double the mortgage, I reckon.
Eh? Ugly, ain't she&mdash;of course! Said she'd been
swindled? That's like a woman! You and me know 'em!
eh, Poinsett?" Mr. Dumphy emitted his characteristic
bark, and winked at his visitor.</p>

<p>Arthur looked up in unaffected surprise. "If you mean
Mrs. Sepulvida," he said, coldly, "I haven't seen her. I
was on my way there when your telegram recalled me. I
had some business with Padre Felipe."</p>

<p>"You don't know then that the Conroy mine has gone
up with the earthquake, eh? Lead dropped out&mdash;eh? and
the widow's fifty-six thousand?"&mdash;here Mr. Dumphy
snapped his finger and thumb, to illustrate the lame and
impotent conclusion of Donna Maria's investment&mdash;"don't
you know that?"</p>

<p>"No," said Arthur, with perfect indifference and a
languid abstraction that awed Mr. Dumphy more than
anxiety; "no, I don't. But I imagine that isn't the
reason you telegraphed me."</p>

<p>"No," returned Dumphy, still eyeing Poinsett keenly for
a possible clue to this singular and unheard-of apathy to
the condition of the fortune of the woman his visitor was
about to marry. "No&mdash;of course!"</p>

<p>"Well!" said Arthur, with that dangerous quiet which
was the only outward sign of interest and determination in
his nature. "I'm going up to One Horse Gulch to offer
my services as counsel to Gabriel Conroy. Now for the
details of this murder, which, by the way, I don't believe
Gabriel committed, unless he's another man than the one
I knew! After that you can tell me <i>your</i> business with
me, for I don't suppose you telegraphed to me on his
account solely. Of course, at first you felt it was to your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
interest to get him and his wife out of the way, now that
Ramirez is gone. But now, if you please, let me know
what <i>you</i> know about this murder."</p>

<p>Mr. Dumphy thus commanded, and completely under
the influence of Arthur's quiet will, briefly recounted the
particulars already known to the reader, of which he had
been kept informed by telegraph.</p>

<p>"He's been recaptured," added Dumphy, "I learn by
a later despatch; and I don't reckon there'll be another
attempt to lynch him. I've managed <i>that</i>," he continued,
with a return of his old self-assertion. "I've got some
influence there!"</p>

<p>For the first time during the interview Arthur awoke
from his pre-occupation, and glanced keenly at Dumphy.
"Of course," he returned, coolly, "I don't suppose you
such a fool as to allow the only witness you have of your
wife's death to be sacrificed&mdash;even if you believed that the
impostor who was personating your wife had been charged
with complicity in a capital crime and had fled from justice.
You're not such a fool as to believe that this Mrs. Conroy
won't try to help her husband, that she evidently loves, by
every means in her power&mdash;that she won't make use of any
secret she may have that concerns you to save him and
herself. No, Mr. Peter Dumphy," said Arthur significantly;
"no, you're too much of a business man not to
see that." As he spoke he noted the alternate flushing and
paling of Mr. Dumphy's face, and read&mdash;I fear with the
triumphant and instinctive consciousness of a superior
intellect&mdash;that Mr. Dumphy <i>had</i> been precisely such a fool,
and had failed!</p>

<p>"I reckon nobody will put much reliance on the evidence
of a woman charged with a capital crime," said Mr.
Dumphy, with a show of confidence he was far from
feeling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span></p>

<p>"Suppose that she and Gabriel both swear that <i>she</i>
knows your abandoned wife, for instance; suppose that
they both swear that she and you connived to personate
Grace Conroy for the sake of getting the title to this mine;
suppose that she alleges that she repented and married
Gabriel, as she did, and suppose that they both admit the
killing of this Ramirez&mdash;and assert that you were persecuting
them through him, and still are; suppose that they show
that he forged a second grant to the mine&mdash;through <i>your</i>
instigation?"</p>

<p>"It's a lie," interrupted Dumphy, starting to his feet; "he
did it from jealousy."</p>

<p>"Can you <i>prove</i> his motives?" said Arthur.</p>

<p>"But the grant was not in my favour&mdash;it was to some old
Californian down in the Mission of San Antonio. I can
prove that," said Dumphy, excitedly.</p>

<p>"Suppose you can? Nobody imagines you so indiscreet
as to have had another grant conveyed to <i>you directly</i>, while
you were negotiating with Gabriel for <i>his</i>. Don't be foolish!
<i>I</i> know you had nothing to do with the forged grant. I
am only suggesting how you have laid yourself open to the
charges of a woman of whom you are likely to make an enemy,
and might have made an ally. If you calculate to revenge
Ramirez, consider first if you care to have it proved that he
was a confidential agent of yours&mdash;as they will, if you don't
help <i>them</i>. Never mind whether they committed the murder.
You are not their judge or accuser. You must help them
for your own sake. No!" continued Arthur, after a pause,
"congratulate yourself that the Vigilance Committee did not
hang Gabriel Conroy, and that you have not to add revenge
to the other motives of a desperate and scheming woman."</p>

<p>"But are you satisfied that Mrs. Conroy <i>is</i> really the
person who stands behind Colonel Starbottle and personates
my wife?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am," replied Arthur, positively.</p>

<p>Dumphy hesitated a moment. Should he tell Arthur of
Colonel Starbottle's interview with him, and the delivery
and subsequent loss of the mysterious envelope? Arthur
read his embarrassment plainly, and precipitated his decision
with a single question.</p>

<p>"Have you had any further interview with Colonel Starbottle?"</p>

<p>Thus directly adjured. Dumphy hesitated no longer, but
at once repeated the details of his late conversation with
Starbottle, his successful bribery of the Colonel, the delivery
of the sealed envelope under certain conditions, and its
mysterious disappearance. Arthur heard him through with
quiet interest, but when Mr. Dumphy spoke of the loss of
the envelope, he fixed his eyes on Mr. Dumphy's with a significance
that was unmistakable.</p>

<p>"You say you lost this envelope trusted to your honour!"
said Arthur, with slow and insulting deliberation. "Lost
it, without having opened it or learned its contents? That
was very unfortunate, Mr. Dumphy, ve-ry un-for-tu-nate!"</p>

<p>The indignation of an honourable man at the imputation
of some meanness foreign to his nature is weak compared
with the anger of a rascal accused of an offence which he
might have committed, but didn't. Mr. Dumphy turned almost
purple! It was so evident that he had not been guilty
of concealing the envelope, and did not know its contents,
that Arthur was satisfied.</p>

<p>"He denied any personal knowledge of Mrs. Conroy in
this affair?" queried Arthur.</p>

<p>"Entirely! He gave me to understand that his instructions
were received from another party unknown to me," said
Dumphy. "Look yer, Poinsett&mdash;you're wrong! I don't
believe it is that woman."</p>

<p>Arthur shook his head. "No one else possesses the information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
necessary to blackmail you. No one else has a
motive in doing it."</p>

<p>The door opened to a clerk bearing a card. Mr.
Dumphy took it impatiently and read aloud, "Colonel
Starbottle of Siskiyou!" He then turned an anxious face
to Poinsett.</p>

<p>"Good," said that gentleman, quietly; "admit him." As
the clerk disappeared, Arthur turned to Dumphy, "I suppose
it was to meet this man you sent for me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," returned Dumphy, with a return of his old
brusqueness.</p>

<p>"Then hold your tongue, and leave everything to me."</p>

<p>The door opened as he spoke to Colonel Starbottle's
frilled shirt and expanding bosom, followed at a respectful
interval by the gallant Colonel himself. He was evidently
surprised by the appearance of Mr. Dumphy's guest, but by
no means dashed in his usual chivalrous port and bearing.
"My legal adviser, Mr. Poinsett," said Dumphy, introducing
Arthur briefly.</p>

<p>The gallant Colonel bowed stiffly, while Arthur, with a
smile of fascinating courtesy and deference that astonished
Dumphy in proportion as it evidently flattered and gratified
Colonel Starbottle, stepped forward and extended his hand.
"As a younger member of the profession I can hardly claim
the attention of one so experienced as Colonel Starbottle,
but as the friend of poor Henry Beeswinger, I can venture
to take the hand of the man who so gallantly stood by him
as his second, two years ago."</p>

<p>"Ged, sir," said Colonel Starbottle, absolutely empurpling
with pleasure, and exploding his handkerchief from his
sweltering breast. "Ged! you&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;do me proud! I
am&mdash;er&mdash;gratified, sir, to meet any friend of&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;gentleman
like Hank Beeswinger! I remember the whole
affair, sir, as if it was yesterday. I do!" with an oath.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
"Gratifying, Mr. Poinsett, to every gentleman concerned.
Your friend, sir,&mdash;I'm proud to meet you&mdash;I am,&mdash;&mdash;me!&mdash;killed,
sir, second fire! Dropped like a gentleman,&mdash;&mdash;me!
No fuss; no reporters; no arrests. Friends
considerate. Blank me, sir, one of the finest, d&mdash;&mdash; me,
I may say, sir, one of the very finest&mdash;er&mdash;meetings
in which I have&mdash;er&mdash;participated. Glad to know you,
sir. You call to mind, sir, one of the&mdash;er&mdash;highest illustrations
of a code of honour&mdash;that&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;under the present&mdash;er&mdash;degrading
state of public sentiment is er&mdash;er&mdash;passing
away. We are drifting sir, drifting&mdash;drifting to er&mdash;er&mdash;political
and social condition, where the Voice of
Honour, sir, is drowned by the Yankee watchword of Produce
and Trade. Trade, sir, blank me!" Colonel Starbottle
paused with a rhetorical full stop, blew his nose, and
gazed at the ceiling with a plaintive suggestion that the
days of chivalry had indeed passed, and that American
institutions were indeed retrograding; Mr. Dumphy leaned
back in his chair in helpless irritability; Mr. Arthur Poinsett
alone retained an expression of courteous and sympathising
attention.</p>

<p>"I am the more gratified at meeting Colonel Starbottle,"
said Arthur, gravely, "from the fact that my friend and
client here, Mr. Dumphy is at present in a condition where
he most needs the consideration and understanding of a
gentleman and a man of honour. A paper, which has
been entrusted to his safe keeping and custody as a gentleman,
has disappeared since the earthquake, and it is
believed that during the excitement of that moment it was
lost! The paper is supposed to be intact, as it was in an
envelope that <i>had never been opened, and whose seals were
unbroken</i>. It is a delicate matter, but I am rejoiced that
the gentleman who left the paper in trust is the honourable
Colonel Starbottle, whom I know by reputation, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
gentleman who suffered the misfortune of losing it is my
personal friend Mr. Dumphy. It enables me at once to
proffer my services as mediator, or as Mr. Dumphy's legal
adviser and friend, to undertake <i>all</i> responsibility in the
matter."</p>

<p>The tone and manner were so like Colonel Starbottle's
own, that Dumphy looked from Arthur to Colonel Starbottle
in hopeless amazement. The latter gentleman
dropped his chin and fixed a pair of astonished and staring
eyes upon Arthur. "Do I understand&mdash;that&mdash;er&mdash;this
gentleman, Mr. Dumphy, has placed you in possession of
any confidential statement&mdash;that&mdash;er"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Colonel Starbottle," interrupted Arthur,
rising with dignity, "the facts I have just stated are
sufficient for the responsibility I assume in this case. I
learn from my client that a sealed paper placed in his
hands is missing. I have from him the statement that I
am bound to believe, that it passed from his hands unopened;
where, he knows not. This is a matter, between
gentlemen, serious enough without further complication!"</p>

<p>"And the paper and envelope are lost?" continued
Colonel Starbottle, still gazing at Arthur.</p>

<p>"Are lost," returned Arthur, quietly. "I have advised
my friend, Mr. Dumphy, that as a man of honour, and a
business man, he is by no means freed through this unfortunate
accident from any promise or contract that he may
have entered into with you concerning it. Any deposit
as a collateral for its safe delivery which he might
have made, <i>or has promised to make</i>, is clearly forfeited.
This he has been waiting only for your appearance to hand
to you." Arthur crossed to Mr. Dumphy's side and laid
his hand lightly upon his shoulder, but with a certain significance
of grip palpable to Mr. Dumphy, who, after
looking into his eyes, took out his cheque book. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
he had filled in a duplicate of the cheque he had given
Colonel Starbottle two days before, Arthur took it from his
hand and touched the bell. "As we will not burden
Colonel Starbottle unnecessarily, your cashier's acceptance
of this paper will enable him to use it henceforth at his
pleasure, and as I expect to have the pleasure of the
Colonel's company to my office, will you kindly have this
done at once?"</p>

<p>The clerk appeared, and at Mr. Poinsett's direction, took
the cheque from the almost passive fingers of Mr. Dumphy.</p>

<p>"Allow me to express my perfect satisfaction with&mdash;er&mdash;er
your explanation!" said Colonel Starbottle, extending
one hand to Arthur, while at the same moment he gracefully
readjusted his shirt-bosom with the other. "Trouble
yourself no further&mdash;regarding the&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;paper. I trust
it will&mdash;er&mdash;yet be found; if not, sir, I shall&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;"
added the Colonel, with honourable resignation, "hold
myself <i>personally responsible</i> to my client, blank me!"</p>

<p>"Was there no mark upon the envelope by which it
might be known without explaining its contents?" suggested
Arthur.</p>

<p>"None, sir, a plain yellow envelope. Stop!" said the
Colonel, striking his forehead with his hand. "Ged, sir!
I do remember now that during our conversation I made a
memorandum, &mdash;&mdash; me, a memorandum upon the face of
it, across it, a name, Ged, sir, the very name of the party
you were speaking of&mdash;Gabriel Conroy!"</p>

<p>"You wrote the name of Gabriel Conroy upon it!
Good! That may lead to its identification without exposing
its contents," returned Arthur. "Well, sir?"</p>

<p>The last two words were addressed to Mr. Dumphy's
clerk, who had entered during the Colonel's speech and
stood staring alternately at him and his employer, holding
the accepted cheque in his hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span></p>

<p>"Give it to the gentleman," said Dumphy, curtly.</p>

<p>The man obeyed. Colonel Starbottle took the cheque,
folded it, and placed it somewhere in the moral recesses of
his breast-pocket. That done, he turned to Mr. Dumphy.
"I need not say&mdash;er&mdash;that&mdash;er&mdash;as far as my personal
counsel and advice to my client can prevail, it will be my
effort to prevent litigation in this&mdash;er&mdash;delicate affair.
Should the envelope&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;turn up! you will of course&mdash;er&mdash;send
it to me, who am&mdash;er&mdash;personally responsible for
it. Ged, sir," continued the Colonel, "I should be proud
to conclude this affair, conducted as it has been on your
side with the strictest honour, over the&mdash;er&mdash;festive-board&mdash;but&mdash;er&mdash;business
prevents me! I leave here in one
hour for One Horse Gulch!"</p>

<p>Both Mr. Dumphy and Poinsett involuntarily started.</p>

<p>"One Horse Gulch?" repeated Arthur.</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash; me! yes! Ged, sir, I'm retained in a murder case
there; the case of this man Gabriel Conroy."</p>

<p>Arthur cast a swift precautionary look at Dumphy.
"Then perhaps we may be travelling companions?" he
said to Starbottle, smiling pleasantly. "I am going there
too. Perhaps my good fortune may bring us in friendly
counsel. You are engaged"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"For the prosecution," interrupted Starbottle, slightly
expanding his chest. "At the request of relatives of the
murdered man&mdash;a Spanish gentleman of&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;large
and influential family connections, I shall assist the District
Attorney, my old friend, Nelse Buckthorne!"</p>

<p>The excitement kindled in Arthur's eyes luckily did not
appear in his voice. It was still pleasant to Colonel
Starbottle's ear, as, after a single threatening glance of
warning at the utterly mystified and half exploding Dumphy,
he turned gracefully toward him. "And if, by the fortunes
of war, we should be again on opposite sides, my dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
Colonel, I trust that our relations may be as gratifying as
they have been to-day. One moment! I am going your
way. Let me beg you to take my arm a few blocks and a
glass of wine afterwards as a stirrup-cup on our journey."
And with a significant glance at Dumphy, Arthur Poinsett
slipped Colonel Starbottle's arm deftly under his own, and
actually marched off with that doughty warrior, a blushing,
expanding, but not unwilling captive.</p>

<p>When the door closed Mr. Dumphy resumed his speech
and action in a single expletive. What more he might
have said is not known, for at the same moment he caught
sight of his clerk, who had entered hastily at the exit of the
others, but who now stood awed and abashed by Mr.
Dumphy's passion. "Dash it all! what in dash are you
dashingly doing here, dash you?"</p>

<p>"Sorry, sir," said the unlucky clerk; "but overhearing
that gentleman say there was writing on the letter that you
lost by which it might be identified, sir&mdash;we think we've
found it&mdash;that is, we know where it is!"</p>

<p>"How?" said Dumphy, starting up eagerly.</p>

<p>"When the shock came that afternoon," continued the
clerk, "the express bag for Sacramento and Marysville had
just been taken out by the expressman, and was lying on
top of the waggon. The horses started to run at the
second shock, and the bag fell and was jammed against a
lamp-post in front of our window, bursting open as it did
so and spilling some letters and papers on the side-walk.
One of our night watchmen helped the expressman pick up
the scattered letters, and picked up among them a plain
yellow envelope with no address but the name of Gabriel
Conroy written in pencil across the end. Supposing it
had dropped from some package in the express bag, he
put it back again in the bag. When you asked about a
blank envelope missing from your desk, he did not connect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
it with the one he had picked up, for <i>that</i> had writing on
it. We sent to the express office just now, and found
that they had stamped it, and forwarded it to Conroy at
One Horse Gulch, just as they had always done with his
letters sent to our care. That's the way of it. Daresay
it's there by this time, in his hands, sir, all right!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

<h5>GABRIEL MEETS HIS LAWYER.</h5>


<p>Gabriel's petition on behalf of Mr. Hamlin was promptly
granted by the sheriff. The waggon was at once put into
requisition to convey the wounded man&mdash;albeit screaming
and protesting&mdash;to the Grand Conroy Hotel, where, in
company with his faithful henchman, he was left, to all
intents a free man, and a half an hour later a demented one,
tossing in a burning fever.</p>

<p>Owing to the insecure condition of the county jail at
One Horse Gulch, and possibly some belief in the equal
untrustworthiness of the people, the sheriff conducted his
prisoner, accompanied by Olly, to Wingdam. Nevertheless,
Olly's statement of the changed condition of public sentiment,
or rather its pre-occupation with a calamity of more
absorbing interest, was in the main correct. The news of
the recapture of Gabriel by his legal guardian awoke no
excitement nor comment. More than this, there was a
favourable feeling toward the prisoner. The action of the
Vigilance Committee had been unsuccessful, and had terminated
disastrously to the principal movers therein. It is
possible that the morality of their action was involved in
their success. Somehow the whole affair had not resulted
to the business interests of the Gulch. The three most
prominent lynchers were dead&mdash;and clearly in error! The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
prisoner, who was still living, was possibly in the right. The
<i>Silverpolis Messenger</i>, which ten days before had alluded to
the "noble spectacle of a free people outraged in their
holiest instincts, appealing to the first principles of Justice
and Order, and rallying as a single man to their support,"
now quietly buried the victims and their motives from the
public eye beneath the calm statement that they met their
fate "while examining the roof of the Court House with a
view to estimate the damage caused by the first shock of
the earthquake." The <i>Banner</i> favoured the same idea a
little less elegantly, and suggested ironically that hereafter
"none but experts should be allowed to go foolin' round
the statue of Justice." I trust that the intelligent reader will
not accuse me of endeavouring to cast ridicule upon the
general accuracy of spontaneous public emotion, nor the infallibility
of the true democratic impulse, which (I beg to
quote from the <i>Messenger</i>), "in the earliest ages of our history
enabled us to resist legalised aggression, and take the reins
of government into our own hands," or (I now refer to the
glowing language of the <i>Banner</i>), "gave us the right to run
the machine ourselves and boss the job." And I trust that
the reader will observe in this passing recognition of certain
inconsistencies in the expression and action of these people,
only the fidelity of a faithful chronicler, and no intent of
churlish criticism nor moral or political admonition, which
I here discreetly deprecate and disclaim.</p>

<p>Nor was there any opposition when Gabriel, upon the
motion of Lawyer Maxwell, was admitted to bail pending
the action of the Grand Jury, nor any surprise when Mr.
Dumphy's agent and banker came forward as his bondsman
for the sum of fifty thousand dollars. By one of those
strange vicissitudes in the fortunes of mining speculation,
this act by Mr. Dumphy was looked upon as an evidence of
his trust in the future of the unfortunate mine of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
Gabriel had been original locator and superintendent, and
under that belief the stock rallied slightly. "It was a
mighty sharp move of Pete Dumphy's bailin' thet Gabe,
right in face of that there 'dropped lead' in his busted-up
mine! Oh, you've got to set up all night to get any points
to show <i>him</i>!" And, to their mutual surprise, Mr. Dumphy
found himself more awe-inspiring than ever at One Horse
Gulch, and Gabriel found himself a free man, with a slight
popular flavour of martyrdom about him.</p>

<p>As he still persistently refused to enter again upon the
premises which he had deeded to his wife on the day of the
murder, temporary lodgings were found for him and Olly
at the Grand Conroy Hotel. And here Mrs. Markle,
although exhibiting to Lawyer Maxwell the greatest concern
in Gabriel's trouble, by one of those inconsistencies of
the sex which I shall not attempt to explain, treated the
unfortunate accused with a degree of cold reserve that was
as grateful, I fear, to Gabriel, as it was unexpected. Indeed,
I imagine that if the kind-hearted widow had known
the real comfort and assurance that the exasperating Gabriel
extracted from her first cold and constrained greeting, she
would have spent less of her time in consultation with Maxwell
regarding his defence. But perhaps I am doing a
large-hearted and unselfish sex a deep injustice. So I
shall content myself with transcribing part of a dialogue
which took pace between them at the Grand Conroy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Markle (loftily, and regarding the ceiling with cold
abstraction): "We can't gin ye here, Mister Conroy, the
French style and attention ye're kinder habitooal to in
your own house on the Hill, bein' plain folks and mounting
ways. But we know our place, and don't reckon to promise
the comforts of a home! Wot with lookin' arter forty
reg'lar and twenty-five transient&mdash;ef I don't happen to see
ye much myself, Mr. Conroy, ye'll understand. Ef ye ring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
thet there bell one o' the help will be always on hand. Yer
lookin' well, Mr. Conroy. And bizness, I reckon" (the
reader will here observe a ladylike ignoring of Gabriel's
special trouble), "ez about what it allers waz, though judging
from remarks of transients, it's dull!"</p>

<p>Gabriel (endeavouring to conceal a large satisfaction under
the thin glowing of conventional sentiment): "Don't let
me nor Olly put ye out a cent, Mrs. Markle&mdash;a change
bein' ordered by Olly's physicians&mdash;and variety bein', so
to speak, the spice o' life! And ye're lookin' well, Mrs.
Markle; that ez" (with a sudden alarm at the danger of
compliment), "so to speak, ez peart and strong-handed ez
ever! And how's thet little Manty o' yours gettin' on?
Jist how it was thet me and Olly didn't get to see ye before
ez mighty queer! Times and times ag'in" (with shameless
mendacity) "hez me and thet child bin on the p'int o'
coming, and suthin' hez jest chipped in and interfered!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Markle (with freezing politeness): "You do me
proud! I jest dropped in ez a matter o' not bein' able
allers to trust to help. Good night, Mister Conroy. I
hope I see you well! Ye kin jest" (retiring with matronly
dignity), "ye kin jest touch onto that bell thar, if ye're
wantin' anything, and help'll come to ye! Good-night!"</p>

<p>Olly (appearing a moment later at the door of Gabriel's
room, truculent and suspicious): "Afore I'd stand thar&mdash;chirpin'
with thet crockidill&mdash;and you in troubil, and not
knowin' wot's gone o' July&mdash;I'd pizen myself!"</p>

<p>Gabriel (blushing to the roots of his hair, and conscience-stricken
to his inmost soul): "It's jest passin' the time o'
day, Olly, with old friends&mdash;kinder influencin' the public
sentyment and the jury. Thet's all. It's the advice o'
Lawyer Maxwell, ez ye didn't get to hear, I reckon,&mdash;thet's
all!"</p>

<p>But Gabriel's experience in the Grand Conroy Hotel was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
not, I fear, always as pleasant. A dark-faced, large-featured
woman, manifestly in mourning, and as manifestly an avenging
friend of the luckless deceased, in whose taking off
Gabriel was supposed to be so largely instrumental, presently
appeared at the Grand Conroy Hotel, waiting the action of
the Grand Jury. She was accompanied by a dark-faced
elderly gentleman, our old friend Don Pedro&mdash;she being
none other than the unstable-waisted Manuela of Pacific
Street&mdash;and was, I believe, in the opinion of One Horse
Gulch, supposed to be charged with convincing and mysterious
evidence against Gabriel Conroy. The sallow-faced
pair had a way of meeting in the corridors of the hotel and
conversing in mysterious whispers in a tongue foreign to
One Horse Gulch and to Olly, strongly suggestive of revenge
and concealed <i>stilettos</i>, that was darkly significant!
Happily, however, for Gabriel, he was presently relieved
from their gloomy espionage by the interposition of a third
party&mdash;Sal Clark. That individual, herself in the deepest
mourning, and representing the deceased in his holiest
affections, it is scarcely necessary to say at once resented
the presence of the strangers. The two women glared at
each other at the public table, and in a chance meeting in
the corridor of the hotel.</p>

<p>"In the name of God, what have we here in this imbecile
and forward creature, and why is this so and after this
fashion?" asked Manuela of Don Pedro.</p>

<p>"Of a verity, I know not," replied Don Pedro, "it is
most possibly a person visited of God!&mdash;a helpless being
of brains. Peradventure, a person filled with <i>aguardiente</i>
or the whisky of the Americans. Have a care, little one,
thou smallest Manuela" (she weighed at least three
hundred pounds), "that she does thee no harm!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile Miss Sarah Clark relieved herself to Mrs.
Markle in quite as positive language. "Ef that black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
mulattar and that dried-up old furriner reckons they're
going to monopolise public sentyment in this yer way
they're mighty mistaken. Ef thar ever was a shameless
piece et's thet old woman&mdash;and, goodness knows, the man's
a poor critter enyway! Ef anybody's goin' to take the
word of that woman under oath, et's mor'n Sal Clark would
do&mdash;that's all! Who ez she&mdash;enyway? I never heard
her name mentioned afore!"</p>

<p>And ridiculous as it may seem to the unprejudiced reader,
this positive expression and conviction of Miss Clark, like
all positive convictions, was not without its influence on
the larger unimpanelled Grand Jury of One Horse Gulch,
and, by reflection, at last on the impanelled jury itself.</p>

<p>"When you come to consider, gentlemen," said one of
those dangerous characters&mdash;a sagacious, far-seeing juror&mdash;"when
you come to consider that the principal witness o'
the prosecution and the people at the inquest don't know
this yer Greaser woman, and kinder throws off her testimony,
and the prosecution don't seem to agree, it looks
mighty queer. And I put it to you as far-minded men, if
it ain't mighty queer? And this yer Sal Clark one of our
own people."</p>

<p>An impression at once inimical to the new mistress and
stranger, and favourable to the accused Gabriel, instantly
took possession of One Horse Gulch.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the man who was largely responsible for this
excitement and these conflicting opinions maintained a
gravity and silence as indomitable and impassive as his
alleged victim, then slumbering peacefully in the little
cemetery on Round Hill. He conversed but little even
with his counsel and friend, Lawyer Maxwell, and received
with his usual submissiveness and gentle deprecatoriness
the statement of that gentleman that Mr. Dumphy had
already bespoken the services of one of the most prominent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
lawyers of San Francisco&mdash;Mr. Arthur Poinsett&mdash;to assist
in the defence. When Maxwell added that Mr. Poinsett
had expressed a wish to hold his first consultation with
Gabriel privately, the latter replied with his usual simplicity,
"I reckon I've nowt to say to him ez I hain't said
to ye, but it's all right!"</p>

<p>"Then I'll expect you over to my office at eleven to-morrow?"
asked Maxwell.</p>

<p>"Thet's so," responded Gabriel, "though I reckon thet
anything you and him might fix up to be dumped onto thet
jury would be pleasin' and satisfactory to me."</p>

<p>At a few minutes of eleven the next morning Mr. Maxwell,
in accordance with a previous understanding with
Mr. Poinsett, put on his hat and left his office in the charge
of that gentleman that he might receive and entertain
Gabriel in complete privacy and confidence. As Arthur
sat there alone, fine gentleman as he was and famous in his
profession, he was conscious of a certain degree of nervousness
that galled his pride greatly. He was about to
meet the man whose cherished sister six years ago he had
stolen! Such, at least, Arthur felt was Gabriel's opinion.
<i>He</i> had no remorse nor consciousness of guilt or wrongdoing
in that act. But in looking at the fact in his professional
habit of viewing both sides of a question, he made
this allowance for the sentiment of the prosecution, and
putting himself, in his old fashion, in the position of his
opponent, he judged that Gabriel might consistently exhibit
some degree of indignation at their first meeting. That
there was, however, really any <i>moral</i> question involved, he
did not believe. The girl, Grace Conroy, had gone with
him readily, after a careful and honourable statement of the
facts of her situation, and Gabriel's authority or concern
in any subsequent sentimental complication he utterly
denied. That he, Arthur, had acted in a most honourable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
high-minded, and even weakly generous fashion towards
Grace, that he had obeyed her frivolous whims as well as
her most reasonable demands, that he had gone back to
Starvation Camp on a hopeless quest just to satisfy her, that
everything had happened exactly as he had predicted, and
that when he had returned to her he found that <i>she</i> had
deserted <i>him</i>&mdash;these&mdash;these were the facts that were incontrovertible!
Arthur was satisfied that he had been honourable
and even generous&mdash;he was quite convinced that this
very nervousness that he now experienced, was solely the
condition of a mind too sympathetic even with the feelings
of an opponent in affliction. "I must <i>not</i> give way to this
absurd Quixotic sense of honour," said this young gentleman
to himself, severely.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, at exactly eleven o'clock, when the staircase
creaked with the strong steady tread of the giant Gabriel,
Arthur felt a sudden start to his pulse. There was a
hesitating rap at the door&mdash;a rap that was so absurdly
inconsistent with the previous tread on the staircase&mdash;as
inconsistent as were all the mental and physical acts of
Gabriel&mdash;that Arthur was amused and reassured. "Come
in," he said, with a return of his old confidence, and the
door opened to Gabriel, diffident and embarrassed.</p>

<p>"I was told by Lawyer Maxwell," said Gabriel slowly,
without raising his eyes, and only dimly cognisant of the
slight, strong, elegant figure before him&mdash;"I was told that
Mr. Arthur Poinsett reckoned to see me to-day at eleven
o'clock&mdash;so I came. Be you Mr. Poinsett?" (Gabriel
here raised his eyes)&mdash;"be you, eh?&mdash;<span class="smcap">God A'mighty!</span> why,
it's&mdash;eh?&mdash;why&mdash;I want to know!&mdash;it can't be!&mdash;yes, it is!"
He stopped&mdash;the recognition was complete!</p>

<p>Arthur did not move. If he had expected an outburst
from the injured man before him he was disappointed.
Gabriel passed his hard palm vaguely and confusedly across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
his forehead and through his hair, and lifted and put back
behind his ears two tangled locks. And then, without
heeding Arthur's proffered hand, yet without precipitation,
anger, or indignation, he strode toward him, and asked
calmly and quietly, as Arthur himself might have done,
"Where is Grace?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Arthur, bluntly. "I have not
known for years. I have never known her whereabouts,
living or dead, since the day I left her at a logger's house
to return to Starvation Camp to bring help to <i>you</i>."
(Arthur could not resist italicising the pronoun, nor despising
himself for doing it when he saw that the full significance
of his emphasis touched the man before him.)
"She was gone when I returned; where, no one knew! I
traced her to the Presidio, but there she had disappeared."</p>

<p>Gabriel raised his eyes to Arthur's. The impression of
nonchalant truthfulness which Arthur's speech always conveyed
to his hearer, an impression that he did not prevaricate
because he was not concerned sufficiently in his
subject, was further sustained by his calm, clear eyes.
But Gabriel did not speak, and Arthur went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"She left the logger's camp voluntarily, of her own free
will, and doubtless for some reason that seemed sufficient
to her. She abandoned me&mdash;if I may so express myself&mdash;left
my care, relieved me of the responsibility I held
towards her relatives"&mdash;he continued, with the first suggestion
of personal apology in his tones&mdash;"without a word
of previous intimation. Possibly she might have got tired
of waiting for me. I was absent two weeks. It was the
tenth day after my departure that she left the logger's
hut."</p>

<p>Gabriel put his hand in his pocket and deliberately drew
out the precious newspaper slip he had once shown to
Olly. "Then thet thar 'Personal' wozent writ by you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
and thet P. A. don't stand for Philip Ashley?" asked
Gabriel, with a hopeless dejection in his tone.</p>

<p>Arthur glanced quickly over the paper, and smiled.
"I never saw this before," he said. "What made you
think <i>I</i> did it?" he asked curiously.</p>

<p>"Because July&mdash;my wife that was&mdash;said that P. A.
meant you," said Gabriel, simply.</p>

<p>"Oh! <i>she</i> said so, did she?" said Arthur, still smiling.</p>

<p>"She did. And ef it wasn't you, who was it?"</p>

<p>"I really don't know," returned Arthur, carelessly;
"possibly it might have been herself. From what I
have heard of your wife, I think this might be one, and
perhaps the most innocent, of her various impostures."</p>

<p>Gabriel cast down his eyes and for a moment was
gravely silent. Then the look of stronger inquiry and
intelligence that he had worn during the interview faded
utterly from his face, and he began again in his old tone of
apology. "For answerin' all my questions, I'm obliged to
ye, Mr. Ashley, and it's right good in ye to remember ol'
times, and ef I hev often thought hard on ye, ye'll kinder
pass that by ez the nat'rel allowin's of a man ez was
worried about a sister ez hasn't been heerd from sens she
left with ye. And ye mustn't think this yer meetin' was o'
my seekin'. I kinder dropped in yer," he added wearily,
"to see a man o' the name o' Poinsett. He allowed to be
yer at eleving o'clock&mdash;mebbee it's airly yet&mdash;mebbee I've
kinder got wrong o' the place!" and he glanced apologetically
around the room.</p>

<p>"<i>My</i> name is Poinsett," said Arthur, smiling, "the name
of Philip Ashley, by which you knew me, was merely the
one I assumed when I undertook the long overland trip."
He said this in no tone of apology or even explanation,
but left the impression on Gabriel's mind that a change of
name, like a change of dress, was part of the outfit of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
gentleman emigrant. And looking at the elegant young
figure before him, it seemed exceedingly plausible. "It
was as Arthur Poinsett, the San Francisco lawyer, that I
made this appointment with you, and it is now as your
old friend Philip Ashley that I invite your confidence, and
ask you to tell me frankly the whole of this miserable business.
I have come to help you, Gabriel, for your own&mdash;for
your sister's sake. And I think I can do it!" He
held out his hand again, and this time not in vain; with a
sudden frank gesture it was taken in both of Gabriel's, and
Arthur felt that the greatest difficulty he had anticipated in
his advocacy of Gabriel's cause had been surmounted.</p>

<p>"He has told me the whole story, I think," said Arthur,
two hours later, when Maxwell returned and found his associate
thoughtfully sitting beside the window alone. "And
I believe it. He is as innocent of this crime as you or I.
Of that I have always been confident. How far he is
accessory <i>after</i> the fact&mdash;I know he is not accessory <i>before</i>&mdash;is
another question. But his story, that to me is perfectly
convincing, I am afraid won't do before a jury and the
world generally. It involves too much that is incredible,
and damning to him secondarily if believed. We must try
something else. As far as I can see, really, it seems that
his own suggestion of a defence, as you told it to me, has
more significance in it than the absurdity you only saw.
We must admit the killing, and confine ourselves to showing
excessive provocation. I know something of the public
sentiment here, and the sympathies of the average jury,
and if Gabriel should tell them the story he has just told
me, they would hang him at once! Unfortunately for him,
the facts show a complication of property interests and
impostures on the part of his wife, of which he is perfectly
innocent, and which are not really the motive of the murder,
but which the jury would instantly accept as a sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
motive. We must fight, understand, this very story from
the outset; you will find it to be the theory of the prosecution;
but if we can keep him silent it cannot be proved
except by him. The facts are such that if he had really
committed the murder he could have defied prosecution,
but through his very stupidity and blind anxiety to shield
his wife, he has absolutely fixed the guilt upon himself."</p>

<p>"Then you don't think that Mrs. Conroy is the culprit?"
asked Maxwell.</p>

<p>"No," said Arthur; "she is capable, but not culpable.
The real murderer has never been suspected nor his presence
known to One Horse Gulch. But I must see him
again, and Olly, and you must hunt up a Chinaman&mdash;one
Ah Fe&mdash;whom Gabriel tells me brought him the note, and
who is singularly enough missing, now that he is wanted."</p>

<p>"But you can't use a Chinaman's evidence before a
jury?" interrupted Maxwell.</p>

<p>"Not directly; but I can find Christian Caucasians who
would be willing to swear to the facts he supplied them
with. I shall get at the facts in a few days&mdash;and then, my
dear fellow," continued Arthur, laying his hand familiarly
and patronisingly on the shoulder of his senior, "and then
you and I will go to work to see how we can get rid of
them."</p>

<p>When Gabriel recounted the events of the day to Olly,
and described his interview with Poinsett, she became
furiously indignant. "And did that man mean to say he
don't know whether Gracey is livin' or dead? And he
pertendin' to hev bin her bo?"</p>

<p>"In coorse," explained Gabriel; "ye disremember, Olly,
that Gracey never hez let on to <i>me</i>, her own brother, whar
she ez, and she wouldn't be going to tell a stranger. Thar's
them personals as she never answered!"</p>

<p>"Mebbe she didn't want to speak to him ag'in," said Olly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
fiercely, with a toss of her curls. "I'd like to know what
he'd bin' sayin' to her&mdash;like his impudence. Enny how he
ought to hev found her out, and she his sweetheart! Why
didn't he go right off to the Presidio? What did he come
back for? Not find her, indeed! Why, Gabe, do you
suppose as July won't find <i>you</i> out soon&mdash;why, I bet anythin'
she knows jest whar you are" (Gabriel trembled and felt
an inward sinking), "and is on'y waitin' to come forward
to the trial. And yer you are taken in ag'in and fooled by
these yer lawyers!&mdash;you old Gabe, you. Let me git at thet
Philip&mdash;Ashley Poinsett&mdash;thet's all!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>

<h5>WHAT AH FE DOES NOT KNOW.</h5>


<p>Thus admonished by the practical-minded Olly, Gabriel
retired precipitately to the secure fastnesses of Conroy's
Hill, where, over a consolatory pipe in his deserted cabin,
he gave himself up to reflections upon the uncertainty of
the sex and the general vagaries of womanhood. At such
times he would occasionally extend his wanderings to the
gigantic pine tree which still towered pre-eminently above
its fellows in ominous loneliness, and seated upon one of its
outlying roots, would gently philosophise to himself regarding
his condition, the vicissitudes of fortune, the awful
prescience of Olly, and the beneficence of a Creator who
permitted such awkward triviality and uselessness as was
incarnate in himself to exist at all! Sometimes, following
the impulse of habit, he would encroach abstractedly upon
the limits of his own domain, and find himself under the
shadow of his own fine house on the hill, from which, since
that eventful parting with his wife, he had always rigidly
withheld his foot. As soon as he would make this alarming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
discovery, he would turn back in honourable delicacy and
a slight sense of superstitious awe. Retreating from one
of these involuntary incursions one day, in passing through
an opening in a little thicket of "buckeye" near his house,
he stumbled over a small workbasket lying in the withered
grass, apparently mislaid or forgotten. Gabriel instantly
recognised it as the property of his wife, and as quickly recalled
the locality as one of her favourite resorts during the
excessive mid-day heats. He hesitated and then passed on,
and then stopped and returned again awkwardly and bashfully.
To have touched any property of his wife's, after
their separation, was something distasteful and impossible
to Gabriel's sense of honour; to leave it there the spoil of
any passing Chinaman, or the prey of the elements, was
equally inconsistent with a certain respect which Gabriel
had for his wife's weaknesses. He compromised by picking
it up with the intention of sending it to Lawyer Maxwell,
as his wife's trustee. But in doing this, to Gabriel's great
alarm (for he would as soon have sacrificed the hand that
held this treasure as to have exposed its contents in curiosity
or suspicion), part of that multitudinous contents overflowed
and fell on the ground, and he was obliged to pick them
up and replace them. One of them was a baby's shirt&mdash;so
small it filled the great hand that grasped it. In Gabriel's
emigrant experience, as the frequent custodian and nurse of
the incomplete human animal, he was somewhat familiar with
those sacred, mummy-like enwrappings usually unknown to
childless men, and he recognised it at once.</p>

<p>He did not replace it in the basket, but, with a suffused
cheek and an increased sense of his usual awkwardness,
stuffed it into the pocket of his blouse. Nor did he send
the basket to Lawyer Maxwell, as he had intended, and in
fact omitted any allusion to it in his usual account to Olly
of his daily experience. For the next two days he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
peculiarly silent and thoughtful, and was sharply reprimanded
by Olly for general idiocy and an especial evasion of some
practical duties.</p>

<p>"Yer's them lawyers hez been huntin' ye to come over
and examine that there Chinaman, Ah Fe, ez is jest turned
up ag'in, and you ain't no whar to be found; and Lawyer
Maxwell sez it's a most important witness. And whar' bouts
was ye found? Down in the Gulch, chirpin' and gossipin'
with that Arkansas family, and totin' round Mrs. Welch's
baby. And you a growed man, with a fammerly of yer
own to look after. I wonder ye ain't got more <i>sabe</i>!&mdash;prancin'
round in this yer shiftless way, and you on trial,
and accused o' killin' folks. Yer a high ole Gabe&mdash;rentin'
yerself out fur a dry nuss for nothin'!"</p>

<p>Gabriel (colouring and hastily endeavouring to awaken
Olly's feminine sympathies): "It waz the powerfullest,
smallest baby&mdash;ye oughter get to see it, Olly! 'Tain't
bigger nor a squirrel&mdash;on'y two weeks old yesterday!"</p>

<p>Olly (outwardly scornful, but inwardly resolving to visit
the phenomenon next week): "Don't stand yawpin' here,
but waltz down to Lawyer Maxwell and see that Chinaman."</p>

<p>Gabriel reached the office of Lawyer Maxwell just as
that gentleman and Arthur Poinsett were rising from a long,
hopeless, and unsatisfactory examination of Ah Fe. The
lawyers had hoped to be able to establish the fact of
Gabriel's remoteness from the scene of the murder by some
corroborating incident or individual that Ah Fe could
furnish in support of the detailed narrative he had already
given. But it did not appear that any Caucasian had been
encountered or met by Ah Fe at the time of his errand.
And Ah Fe's memory of the details he had already described
was apparently beginning to be defective; it was evident
nothing was to be gained from him even if he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
constituted a legal witness. And then, more than all, he
was becoming sullen!</p>

<p>"We are afraid that we haven't made much out of your
friend, Ah Fe," said Arthur, taking Gabriel's hand. "You
might try if <i>you</i> can revive his memory, but it looks
doubtful."</p>

<p>Gabriel gazed at Ah Fe intently&mdash;possibly because he
was the last person who had spoken to his missing wife.
Ah Fe returned the gaze, discharging all expression from
his countenance, except a slight suggestion of the habitual
vague astonishment always seen in the face of a newborn
infant. Perhaps this peculiar expression, reminding Gabriel
as it did of the phenomenon in the Welch family, interested
him. But the few vague wandering questions he put were
met by equally vague answers. Arthur rose in some impatience;
Lawyer Maxwell wiped away the smile that had
been lingering around his mouth. The interview was
ended.</p>

<p>Arthur and Maxwell passed down the narrow stairway
arm in arm. Gabriel would have followed them with Ah
Fe, but turning toward that Mongolian, he was alarmed by
a swift spasm of expression that suddenly convulsed Ah
Fe's face. He winked both his eyes with the velocity of
sheet-lightning, nodded his head with frightful rapidity,
and snapped and apparently dislocated every finger on his
right hand. Gabriel gazed at him in open-mouthed
wonder.</p>

<p>"All litee!" said Ah Fe, looking intently at Gabriel.</p>

<p>"Which?" asked Gabriel.</p>

<p>"All litee! You shabbee 'all litee!' <i>She</i> say 'all litee.'"</p>

<p>"Who's <i>she</i>?" asked Gabriel, in sudden alarm.</p>

<p>"You lifee!&mdash;shabbee?&mdash;Missee Conloy! She likee you&mdash;shabbee?
Me likee you!&mdash;shabbee? Miss Conloy she
say 'all litee!' You shabbee shelliff?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span></p>

<p>"Which?" said Gabriel.</p>

<p>"Shelliff! Man plenty chokee bad man!"</p>

<p>"Sheriff, I reckon," suggested Gabriel, with great
gravity.</p>

<p>"Um! Shelliff. Mebbe you shabbee him bimeby. He
chokee bad man. Much chokee. Chokee like hellee!
<i>He no chokee you.</i> No. Shabbee? She say 'shelliff no
chokee you.' Shabbee?"</p>

<p>"I see," said Gabriel, significantly.</p>

<p>"She say," continued Ah Fe, with gasping swiftness,
"she say you talkee too much. She say me talkee too

too much. She say 'no talkee!' Shabbee? She say 'ash
up!' Shabbee? She say 'dly up!' Shabbee? She say
'bimeby plenty talkee&mdash;bimeby all litee!' Shabbee?"</p>

<p>"But whar ez she&mdash;whar kin I git to see her?" asked
Gabriel.</p>

<p>Ah Fe's face instantly discharged itself of all expression.
A wet sponge could not have more completely obliterated
all pencilled outline of character or thought from his blank
slate-coloured physiognomy than did Gabriel's simple question.
He returned his questioner's glance with ineffable
calmness and vacancy, patiently drew the long sleeves of
his blouse still further over his varnished fingers, crossed
them submissively and Orientally before him, and waited
apparently for Gabriel to become again intelligible.</p>

<p>"Look yer," said Gabriel, with gentle persuasiveness, "ef
it's the same to ye, you'd be doin' me a heap o' good ef
you'd let on whar thet July&mdash;thet Mrs. Conroy ez. Bein'
a man ez in his blindness bows down to wood and stun, ye

brother Pagan&mdash;whar ez she?"</p>

<p>A faint, flickering smile of pathetic abstraction and simplicity,
as of one listening to far-off but incomprehensible
music stole over Ah Fe's face. Then he said kindly, gently,
but somewhat vaguely and unsatisfactorily&mdash;</p>

<p>"Me no shabbee Melican man. Me washee shirtee!

<h4>CHAPTER V.</h4>

<h5>THE PEOPLE <i>V.</i> JOHN DOE <i>alias</i> GABRIEL CONROY, AND
JANE ROE <i>alias</i> JULIE CONROY. BEFORE BOOMPOINTER,
J.</h5>


<p>The day of the trial was one of exacting and absorbing
interest to One Horse Gulch. Long before ten o'clock
the Court-room, and even the halls and corridors of the
lately rehabilitated Court House, were thronged with spectators.
It is only fair to say that by this time the main
points at issue were forgotten. It was only remembered
that some of the first notabilities of the State had come up
from Sacramento to attend the trial; that one of the most
eminent lawyers in San Francisco had been engaged for
the prisoner at a fee variously estimated from fifty to one
hundred thousand dollars, and that the celebrated Colonel
Starbottle of Siskiyou was to assist in the prosecution;
that a brisk duel of words, and it was confidently hoped, a
later one of pistols, would grow out of this forensic encounter;
that certain disclosures affecting men and women
of high social standing were to be expected; and, finally,
that in some mysterious way a great political and sectional
principle (Colonel Starbottle was from the South and Mr.
Poinsett from the North) was to be evolved and upheld<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
during the trial&mdash;these were the absorbing fascinations to
One Horse Gulch.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock Gabriel, accompanied by his counsel,
entered the Court-room, followed by Colonel Starbottle.
Judge Boompointer, entering at the same moment, bowed
distantly to Arthur, and familiarly to Colonel Starbottle.
In his <i>otium</i> off the bench, he had been chaffed by the
District Attorney, and had lost large sums at play with
Colonel Starbottle. Nevertheless he was a trifle uneasy
under the calmly critical eyes of the famous young advocate
from San Francisco. Arthur was too wise to exhibit
his fastidiousness before the Court; nevertheless, Judge
Boompointer was dimly conscious that he would on that
occasion have preferred that the Clerk who sat below him
had put on a cleaner shirt, and himself refrained from
taking off his cravat and collar, as was his judicial habit
on the Wingdam circuit. There was some slight prejudice
on the part of the panel to this well-dressed young lawyer,
which they were pleased to specify and define more particularly
as his general "airiness." Seeing which, Justice,
on the bench, became more dignified, and gazed severely
at the panel and at Arthur.</p>

<p>In the selection of the jury there was some difficulty; it
was confidently supposed that the prisoner's counsel would
challenge the array on the ground of the recent Vigilance
excitement, but public opinion was disappointed when the
examination of the defence was confined to trivial and
apparently purposeless inquiry into the nativity of the
several jurors. A majority of those accepted by the
defence were men of Southern birth and education.
Colonel Starbottle, who, as a representative of the peculiar
chivalry of the South, had always adopted this plan himself,
in cases where his client was accused of assault and
battery, or even homicide, could not in respect to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
favourite traditions object to it. But when it was found
that there were only two men of Northern extraction on the
jury, and that not a few of them had been his own clients,
Colonel Starbottle thought he had penetrated the theory of
the defence.</p>

<p>I regret that Colonel Starbottle's effort, admirably characterised
by the <i>Banner</i> as "one of the most scathing and
Junius-like gems of legal rhetoric ever known to the Californian
Bar," has not been handed down to me <i>in extenso</i>.
Substantially, however, it appeared that Colonel Starbottle
had never before found himself in "so peculiar, so momentous,
so&mdash;er&mdash;delicate a position. A position, sir&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;gentlemen,
fraught with the deepest social, professional&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;he
should not hesitate to say, upon his
own personal responsibility, a position of the deepest political
significance! Colonel Starbottle was aware that this
statement might be deprecated&mdash;nay, even <i>assailed</i> by
some. But he did not retract that statement. Certainly
not in the presence of that jury, in whose intelligent faces
he saw&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;justice&mdash;inflexible justice!&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;mingled
and&mdash;er&mdash;mixed with&mdash;with chivalrous instinct,
and suffused with the characteristic&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;glow of&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;!" (I
regret to add that at this supreme moment, as
the Colonel was lightly waving away with his fat right hand
the difficulties of rhetoric, a sepulchral voice audible behind
the jury suggested "Robinson County whisky" as the
origin of the phenomena the Colonel hesitated to describe.
The judge smiled blandly and directed the deputy sheriff
to preserve order. The deputy obeyed the mandate by
looking over into the crowd behind the jury, and saying, in
an audible tone, "You'd better dry up thar, Joe White, or
git out o' that!" and the Colonel, undismayed, proceeded.)
"He well understood the confidence placed by the defence
in these gentlemen. He had reason to believe that an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
attempt would be made to show that this homicide was
committed in accordance with certain&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;principles
held by honourable men&mdash;that the act was retributive, and
in defence of an invasion of domestic rights and the sanctity
of wedlock. But he should show them its fallacy. He
should show them that only a base pecuniary motive influenced
the prisoner. He should show them&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;that
the accused had placed himself, firstly, by his antecedent
acts, and, secondly, by the manner of the later act, beyond
the sympathies of honourable men. He should show them
a previous knowledge of certain&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;indiscretions on
the part of the prisoner's wife, and a condonation by the
prisoner of those indiscretions, that effectually debarred the
prisoner from the provisions of the code; he should show
an inartistic, he must say, even on his own personal
responsibility, a certain ungentlemanliness, in the manner
of the crime that refused to clothe it with the&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;generous
mantle of chivalry. The crime of which the
prisoner was accused might have&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;been committed
by a Chinaman or a nigger. Colonel Starbottle did not
wish to be misunderstood. It was not in the presence of&mdash;er&mdash;Beauty&mdash;" (the
Colonel paused, drew out his handkerchief,
and gracefully waved it in the direction of the dusky
Manuela and the truculent Sal&mdash;both ladies acknowledging
the courtesy as an especial and isolated tribute, and
exchanging glances of the bitterest hatred)&mdash;"it is not,
gentlemen, in the presence of an all-sufficient and enthralling
sex that I would seek to disparage their influence with
man. But I shall prove that this absorbing&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;passion,
this&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;delicious&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;fatal weakness,
that rules the warlike camp, the&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;stately palace, as
well as the&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;cabin of the base-born churl, never
touched the calculating soul of Gabriel Conroy! Look at
him, gentlemen! Look at him, and say upon your oaths,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
upon your experience as men of gallantry, if he is a man
to sacrifice himself for a woman. Look at him, and say
truly, as men personally responsible for their opinions, if he
is a man to place himself in a position of peril through
the blandishments of&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;Beauty, or sacrifice himself
upon the&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;altar of Venus!"</p>

<p>Every eye was turned upon Gabriel. And certainly at
that moment he did not bear any striking resemblance to a
sighing Amintor or a passionate Othello. His puzzled,
serious face, which had worn a look of apologetic sadness,
was suffused at this direct reference of the prosecution;
and the long, heavy lower limbs, which he had diffidently
tucked away under his chair to reduce the elevation of his
massive knees above the ordinary level of one of the court-room
chairs, retired still further. Finding himself, during
the Colonel's rhetorical pause, still the centre of local
observation, he slowly drew from his pocket a small comb,
and began awkwardly to comb his hair, with an ineffective
simulation of pre-occupation and indifference.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," continued the Colonel, with that lofty forensic
severity so captivating to the spectator, "you may comb
yer hair" (hyar was the Colonel's pronunciation), "but yer
can't comb it so as to make this intelligent jury believe
that it is fresh from the hands of&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;Delilah."</p>

<p>The Colonel then proceeded to draw an exceedingly
poetical picture of the murdered Ramirez&mdash;"a native,
appealing to the sympathies of every Southern man, a
native of the tropics, impulsive, warm, and peculiarly
susceptible, as we all are, gentlemen, to the weaknesses of
the heart." The Colonel "would not dwell further upon
this characteristic of the deceased. There were within the
sound of his voice, visible to the sympathising eyes of the
jury, two beings who had divided his heart's holiest affections&mdash;their
presence was more eloquent than words. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
man," continued the Colonel, "a representative of one of
our oldest Spanish families&mdash;a family that recalled the days
of&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;the Cid and Don John&mdash;this man had been
the victim at once of the arts of Mrs. Conroy and the
dastardly fears of Gabriel Conroy; of the wiles of the
woman and the stealthy steel of the man."</p>

<p>"Colonel Starbottle would show that personating the
character and taking the name of Grace Conroy, an absent
sister of the accused, Mrs. Conroy, then really Madame
Devarges, sought the professional aid of the impulsive and
generous Ramirez to establish her right to a claim then
held by the accused&mdash;in fact, wrongfully withheld from
his own sister, Grace Conroy. That Ramirez, believing
implicitly in the story of Madame Devarges with the sympathy
of an overflowing nature, gave her that aid until her
marriage with Gabriel exposed the deceit. Colonel Starbottle
would not characterise the motives of such a
marriage. It was apparent to the jury. They were intelligent
men, and would detect the unhallowed combination
of two confederates, under the sacrament of a holy institution,
to deceive the trustful Ramirez. It was a nuptial
feast at which&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;Mercury presided, and not&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;Hymen.
Its only issue was fraud and murder.
Having obtained possession of the property in a common
interest, it was necessary to remove the only witness of the
fraud, Ramirez. The wife found a willing instrument in
the husband. And how was the deed committed? Openly
and in the presence of witnesses? Did Gabriel even
assume a virtue, and under the pretext of an injured husband
challenge the victim to the field of honour? No!
No, gentlemen. Look at the murderer, and contrast his
enormous bulk with the&mdash;er&mdash;slight, graceful, youthful
figure of the victim, and you will have an idea of the&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;enormity
of the crime."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span></p>

<p>After this exordium came the <i>testimony&mdash;i.e.</i>, facts
coloured more or less unconsciously, according to the
honest prejudices of the observer, his capacity to comprehend
the fact he had observed, and his disposition to give
his theory regarding that fact rather than the fact itself.
And when the blind had testified to what they saw, and the
halt had stated where they walked and ran, the prosecution
rested with a flush of triumph.</p>

<p>They had established severally: that the deceased had
died from the effects of a knife wound; that Gabriel had
previously quarrelled with him and was seen on the hill
within a few hours of the murder; that he had absconded
immediately after, and that his wife was still a fugitive, and
that there was ample motive for the deed in the circumstances
surrounding the prisoner.</p>

<p>Much of this was shaken on cross-examination. The
surgeon who made the autopsy was unable to say whether
the deceased, being consumptive, might not have died from
consumption that very night. The witness who saw
Gabriel pushing the deceased along the road, could not
swear positively whether the deceased were not pulling
Gabriel instead, and the evidence of Mrs. Conroy's
imposture was hearsay only. Nevertheless bets were
offered in favour of Starbottle against Poinsett&mdash;that being
the form in which the interest of One Horse Gulch
crystallised itself.</p>

<p>When the prosecution rested, Mr. Poinsett, as counsel
for defence, moved for the discharge of the prisoner, no
evidence having been shown of his having had any relations
with or knowledge of the deceased until the day of
the murder, and none whatever of his complicity with the
murderess, against whom the evidence of the prosecution
and the arguments of the learned prosecuting attorney
were chiefly directed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span></p>

<p>Motion overruled. A sigh of relief went up from the
spectators and the jury. That any absurd technical
objection should estop them from that fun which as law-abiding
citizens they had a right to expect, seemed
oppressive and scandalous; and when Arthur rose to open
for the defence, it was with an instinctive consciousness
that his audience were eyeing him as a man who had
endeavoured to withdraw from a race.</p>

<p>Ridiculous as it seemed in reason, it was enough to
excite Arthur's flagging interest and stimulate his combativeness.
With ready tact he fathomed the expectation
of the audience, and at once squarely joined issue with the
Colonel.</p>

<p>Mr. Poinsett differed from his learned friend in believing
this case was at all momentous or peculiar. It was a
quite common one&mdash;he was sorry to say a <i>very</i> common
one&mdash;in the somewhat hasty administration of the law in
California. He was willing to admit a peculiarity in his
eloquent brother's occupying the line of attack, when his
place was as clearly at his, Mr. Poinsett's side. He should
overlook some irregularities in the prosecution from this
fact, and from the natural confusion of a man possessing
Colonel Starbottle's quick sympathies, who found himself
arrayed against his principles. He should, however,
relieve them from that confusion, by stating that there
really was no principle involved beyond the common one
of self-preservation. He was willing to admit the counsel's
ingenious theory that Mrs. Conroy&mdash;who was not mentioned
in the indictment, or indeed any other person not
specified&mdash;had committed the deed for which his client was
charged. But as they were here to try Gabriel Conroy
only, he could not see the relevancy of the testimony to
that fact. He should content himself with the weakness of
the accusation. He should not occupy their time, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
should call at once to the stand the prisoner; the man
who, the jury would remember, was now, against all legal
precedent, actually, if not legally, placed again in peril of
his life, in the very building which but a few days before
had seen his danger and his escape.</p>

<p>He should call Gabriel Conroy!</p>

<p>There was a momentary sensation in the court. Gabriel
uplifted his huge frame slowly, and walked quietly toward
the witness-box. His face slightly flushed under the half-critical,
half-amused gaze of the spectators, and those by
whom he brushed as he made his way through the crowd
noticed that his breathing was hurried. But when he reached
the box, his face grew more composed, and his troubled
eyes presently concentrated their light fixedly upon Colonel
Starbottle. Then the clerk mumbled the oath, and he took
his seat.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" asked Arthur.</p>

<p>"I reckon ye mean my real name?" queried Gabriel, with
a touch of his usual apology.</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly, your real name, sir," replied Arthur, a
little impatiently.</p>

<p>Colonel Starbottle pricked up his ears, and lifting his
eyes, met Gabriel's dull, concentrated fires full in his own.</p>

<p>Gabriel then raised his eyes indifferently to the ceiling.
"My real name&mdash;my genooine name&mdash;is Johnny Dumbledee,
J-o-n-n-y, Johnny, D-u-m-b-i-l-d-e, Johnny Dumbledee!"</p>

<p>There was a sudden thrill, and then a stony silence.
Arthur and Maxwell rose to their feet at the same moment.
"What?" said both those gentlemen, sharply, in one
breath.</p>

<p>"Johnny Dumbledee," repeated Gabriel, slowly and with
infinite deliberation; "Johnny Dumbledee ez my real name.
I hev frequent," he added, turning around in easy confidence
to the astonished Judge Boompointer, "I hev frequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
allowed I was Gabriel Conroy&mdash;the same not being the
truth. And the woman ez I married&mdash;<i>her</i> name was Grace
Conroy, and the heap o' lies ez thet old liar over thar" (he
indicated the gallant Colonel Starbottle with his finger) "hez
told passes my pile! Thet woman, my wife ez was and ez&mdash;waz
Grace Conroy." (To the Colonel, gravely:) "You
hear me! And the only imposture, please your Honour
and this yer Court, and you gentl'men, was ME!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER VI.</h4>

<h5>IN REBUTTAL.</h5>


<p>The utter and complete astonishment created by Gabriel's
reply was so generally diffused that the equal participation
of Gabriel's own counsel in this surprise was unobserved.
Maxwell would have risen again hurriedly, but Arthur laid
his hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"The man his gone clean mad!&mdash;this is suicide,"
whispered Maxwell, excitedly. "We must get him off the
stand. You must explain!"</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Arthur, quietly. "Not a word! Show
any surprise and we're lost!"</p>

<p>In another instant all eyes were fixed upon Arthur, who
had remained standing, outwardly calm. There was but
one idea dominant in the audience. What revelation would
the next question bring? The silence became almost painful
as Arthur quietly and self-containedly glanced around
the Court-room and at the jury, as if coolly measuring the
effect of a carefully-planned dramatic sensation. Then,
when every neck was bent forward and every ear alert,
Arthur turned nonchalantly yet gracefully to the bench.</p>

<p>"We have no further questions to ask, your Honour," he
said, quietly, and sat down.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span></p>

<p>The effect of this simple, natural, and perfectly consistent
action was tremendous! In the various triumphs of Arthur's
successful career, he felt that he had never achieved as universal
and instantaneous popularity. Gabriel was forgotten;
the man who had worked up this sensation&mdash;a sensation
whose darkly mysterious bearing upon the case no one could
fathom, or even fared to fathom, but a sensation that each
man confidently believed held the whole secret of the crime&mdash;this
man was the hero! Had it been suggested, the jury
would have instantly given a verdict for this hero's client
without leaving their seats. The betting was two to one on
Arthur. I beg to observe that I am writing of men, impulsive,
natural, and unfettered in expression and action by any
tradition of logic or artificial law&mdash;a class of beings much
idealised by poets, and occasionally, I believe, exalted by
latter-day philosophers.</p>

<p>Judge Boompointer looked at Colonel Starbottle. That
gentleman, completely stunned and mystified by the conduct
of the defence, fumbled his papers, coughed, expanded
his chest, rose, and began the cross-examination.</p>

<p>"You have said your name was&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;Johnny&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;(the
Colonel was here obliged to consult his papers)&mdash;er&mdash;John
Dumbledee. What was your idea, Mr. Dumbledee,
in&mdash;er&mdash;assuming the name of&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;Gabriel Conroy?"</p>

<p>Objected to by counsel for defence. Argument:&mdash;Firstly,
motives, like beliefs, not admissible; case cited,
Higginbottom <i>v.</i> Smithers. Secondly, not called out on
Direct Ex.; see Swinke <i>v.</i> Swanke, opinion of Muggins, J.,
2 Cal. Rep. Thirdly, witness not obliged to answer questions
tending to self-crimination. Objection overruled by
the Court. Precedent not cited; real motive, Curiosity.
Boompointer, J. Question repeated:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What was your idea or motive in assuming the name
of Gabriel Conroy?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span></p>

<p>Gabriel (cunningly, and leaning confidentially over the
arm of his chair): "Wot would be <i>your</i> idee of a motif?"</p>

<p>The witness, amidst much laughter, was here severely
instructed by the Court that the asking of questions
was not the function of a witness. The witness must
answer.</p>

<p>Gabriel: "Well, Gabriel Conroy was a purty name&mdash;the
name of a man ez I onst knew ez died in Starvation Camp.
It kinder came easy, ez a sort o' interduckshun, don't ye
see, Jedge, toe his sister Grace, ez was my wife. I kinder
reckon, between you and me, ez thet name sorter helped
the courtin' along&mdash;she bein' a shy critter, outer her own
fammerly."</p>

<p>Question: "In your early acquaintance with the deceased,
were you not known to him as Gabriel Conroy always, and
not as&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;Johnny Dumbledee?"</p>

<p>Arthur Poinsett here begged to call the attention of the
Court to the fact that it had not yet been shown that
Gabriel&mdash;that is Johnny Dumbledee&mdash;has ever had any
<i>early</i> acquaintance with the deceased. The Court would
not fail to observe that counsel on the direct examination
had restricted themselves to a simple question&mdash;the name
of the prisoner.</p>

<p>Objection sustained by Judge Boompointer, who was
beginning to be anxious to get at the facts. Whereat
Colonel Starbottle excepted, had no more questions to ask,
and Gabriel was commanded to stand aside.</p>

<p>Betting now five to one on Arthur Poinsett; Gabriel's
hand, on leaving the witness box, shaken cordially by a
number of hitherto disinterested people. Hurried consultation
between defendant's counsel. A note handed to
Colonel Starbottle. Intense curiosity manifested by Manuela
and Sal regarding a closely veiled female, who enters
a moment later, and is conducted with an excess of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
courtesy to a seat by the gallant Colonel. General impatience
of audience and jury.</p>

<p>The defence resumed. Michael O'Flaherty called;
nativity, County Kerry, Ireland. Business, miner. On the
night of the murder, while going home from work, met
deceased on Conroy's Hill, dodging in among the trees, for
all the wurreld like a thafe. A few minutes later overtook
Gabriel Conroy half a mile farther on, on the same road,
going in same direction as witness, and walked with him to
Lawyer Maxwell's office. Cross examined: Is naturalised.
Always voted the Dimmycratic ticket. Was always opposed
to the Government&mdash;bad cess to it&mdash;in the ould counthry,
and isn't thet mane to go back on his principles here.
Doesn't know that a Chinaman has affirmed to the same
fact of Gabriel's <i>alibi</i>. Doesn't know what an <i>alibi</i> is;
thinks he would if he saw it. Believes a Chinaman is worse
nor a nigger. Has noticed that Gabriel was left-handed.</p>

<p>Amadee Michet, sworn for defence; nativity, France.
Business, foreman of <i>La Parfait Union</i>. Frequently walks
to himself in the beautiful grove on Conroy's Hill. Comes
to him on the night of the 15th, Gabriel Conroy departing
from his house. It is then seven hours, possibly more, not
less. The night is fine. This Gabriel salutes him in the
American fashion, and is gone. Eastward. Ever to the
east. Watches M. Conroy because he wears a <i>triste</i> look,
as if there were great sadness <i>here</i> (in the breast of the
witness' blouse). Sees him vanish in the gulch. Returns
to the hill and there overhears voices, a man's and a
woman's. The woman's voice is that of Madame Conroy.
The man's voice is to him strange and not familiar. Will
swear positively it was not Gabriel's. Remains on the hill
about an hour. Did not see Gabriel again. Saw a man
and woman leave the hill and pass by the Wingdam road
as he was going home. To the best of his belief the woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
was Mrs. Conroy. Do not know the man. Is positive it
was not Gabriel Conroy. Why? Eh! Mon Dieu, is it
possible that one should mistake a giant?</p>

<p>Cross examined. Is a patriot&mdash;do not know what is this
Democrat you call. Is a hater of aristocrats. Do not
know if the deceased was an aristocrat. Was not enraged
with Madame Conroy. Never made love to her. Was
not jilted by her. This is all what you call too theen, eh?
Has noticed that the prisoner was left-handed.</p>

<p>Helling Dittmann; nativity, Germany. Does not know
the deceased; does know Gabriel. Met him the night of
the 15th on the road from Wingdam; thinks it was after
eight o'clock. He was talking to a Chinaman.</p>

<p>Cross examined. Has not been told that these are the
facts stated by the Chinaman. Believes a Chinaman as
good as any other man. Don't know what you mean.
How comes dese dings? Has noticed the prisoner used his
left hand efery dime.</p>

<p>Dr. Pressnitz recalled. Viewed the body at nine o'clock
on the 16th. The blood-stains on the linen and the body
had been slightly obliterated and diluted with water, as if
they had been subjected to a watery application. There
was an unusually heavy dew at seven o'clock that evening,
not later. Has kept a meteorological record for the last
three years. Is of the opinion that this saturation might be
caused by dew falling on a clot of coagulated blood. The
same effect would not be noticeable on a freshly bleeding
wound. The hygrometer showed no indication of a later
fall of dew. The night was windy and boisterous after eight
o'clock, with no humidity. Is of the opinion that the body,
as seen by him, first assumed its position before eight
o'clock. Would not swear positively that the deceased expired
before that time. Would swear positively that the
wounds were not received after eight o'clock. From the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
position of the wound, should say it was received while the
deceased was in an upright position, and the arm raised as
if in struggling. From the course of the wound should say
it could not have been dealt from the left hand of an opponent.
On the cross examination, Dr. Pressnitz admitted
that many so-called "left-handed men" were really ambidexterous.
Was of the opinion that perspiration would <i>not</i>
have caused the saturation of the dead man's linen. The
saturation was evidently after death&mdash;the blood had clotted.
Dr. Pressnitz was quite certain that a dead man did not
perspire.</p>

<p>The defence rested amid a profound sensation. Colonel
Starbottle, who had recovered his jaunty spirits, apparently
influenced by his animated and gallant conversation with
the veiled female, rose upon his short stubby feet, and withdrawing
his handkerchief from his breast, laid it upon the
table before him. Then carefully placing the ends of two
white pudgy fingers upon it, Colonel Starbottle gracefully
threw his whole weight upon their tips, and leaning elegantly
toward the veiled figure, called "Grace Conroy."</p>

<p>The figure arose, slight, graceful, elegant; hesitated a
moment, and then slipped a lissom shadow through the
crowd, as a trout glides through a shallow, and before the
swaying, moving mass had settled to astonished rest, stood
upon the witness-stand. Then with a quick dexterous
movement she put aside the veil, that after the Spanish
fashion was both bonnet and veil, and revealed a face so
exquisitely beautiful and gracious, that even Manuela and
Sal were awed into speechless admiration. She took the
oath with downcast lids, whose sweeping fringes were so
perfect that this very act of modesty seemed to the two
female critics as the most artistic coquetry, and then raised
her dark eyes and fixed them upon Gabriel.</p>

<p>Colonel Starbottle waved his hand with infinite gallantry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is&mdash;er&mdash;your name?"</p>

<p>"Grace Conroy."</p>

<p>"Have you a brother by the name of Gabriel Conroy?"</p>

<p>"I have."</p>

<p>"Look around the Court and see if you can recognise
him."</p>

<p>The witness with her eyes still fixed on Gabriel pointed
him out with her gloved finger. "I do. He is there!"</p>

<p>"The prisoner at the bar?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"He is Gabriel Conroy?"</p>

<p>"He is."</p>

<p>"How long is it since you have seen him?"</p>

<p>"Six years."</p>

<p>"Where did you see him last, and under what circumstances?"</p>

<p>"At Starvation Camp, in the Sierras. I left there to get
help for him and my sister."</p>

<p>"And you have never seen him since?"</p>

<p>"Never!"</p>

<p>"Are you aware that among the&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;unfortunates
who perished, a body that was alleged to be yours was identified?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Can you explain that circumstance?"</p>

<p>"Yes. When I left I wore a suit of boy's clothes. I
left my own garments for Mrs. Peter Dumphy, one of our
party. It was her body, clothed in my garments, that was
identified as myself."</p>

<p>"Have you any proof of that fact other than your statement?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Mr. Peter Dumphy, the husband of Mrs. Dumphy,
my brother Gabriel Conroy, and"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"May it please the Court" (the voice was Arthur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
Poinsett's, cool, quiet, and languidly patient), "may it please
the Court, we of the defence&mdash;to save your Honour and
the jury some time and trouble&mdash;are willing to admit this
identification of our client as Gabriel Conroy, and the
witness, without further corroboration than her own word,
as his sister. Your Honour and the gentlemen of the jury
will not fail to recognise in the evidence of our client as to
his own name and origin, a rash, foolish, and, on behalf of
myself and my colleague, I must add, unadvised attempt
to save the reputation of the wife he deeply loves from the
equally unadvised and extraneous evidence brought forward
by the prosecution. But we must insist, your Honour, that
all this is impertinent to the real issue, the killing of Victor
Ramirez by John Doe, <i>alias</i> Gabriel Conroy. Admitting
the facts just testified to by the witness, Grace Conroy, we
have no cross examination to make."</p>

<p>The fact of the witness, which had been pale and self-possessed,
flushed suddenly as she turned her eyes upon
Arthur Poinsett. But that self-contained scamp retained
an unmoved countenance as, at Judge Boompointer's
unusually gracious instruction that the witness might retire,
Grace Conroy left the stand. To a question from the
Court, Colonel Starbottle intimated that he should offer no
further evidence in rebuttal.</p>

<p>"May it please the Court," said Arthur, quietly, "if we
accept the impeachment by a sister of a brother on trial for
his life, without comment or cross examination, it is because
we are confident&mdash;legally confident&mdash;of showing the innocence
of that brother by other means. Recognising the
fact that this trial is not for the identification of the prisoner
under any name or <i>alias</i>, but simply upon the issue of the
fact whether he did or did not commit murder upon the
body of Victor Ramirez, as specified in the indictment, we
now, waiving all other issues, prepare to prove his innocence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
by a single witness. That this witness was not produced
earlier, was unavoidable; that his testimony was not outlined
in the opening, was due to the fact that only within
the last half-hour had he been within the reach of the
mandate of this Court. He would call Henry Perkins!"</p>

<p>There was a slight stir among the spectators by the door
as they made way to a quaint figure that, clad in garments of
a bygone fashion, with a pale, wrinkled, yellow face, and grey
hair, from which the dye had faded, stepped upon the stand.</p>

<p>Is a translator of Spanish and searcher of deeds to the
Land Commission. Is called an expert. Recognises the
prisoner at the bar. Saw him only once, two days before
the murder, in passing over Conroy's Hill. He was sitting
on the doorstep of a deserted cabin with a little girl by his
side. Saw the deceased twice. Once when he came to
Don Pedro's house in San Francisco to arrange for the
forgery of a grant that should invalidate one already held
by the prisoner's wife. Saw the deceased again, after the
forgery, on Conroy's Hill, engaged in conversation with the
prisoner's wife. Deceased appeared to be greatly excited,
and suddenly drew a knife and made an attack upon the
prisoner's wife. Witness reached forward and interposed
in defence of the woman, when the deceased turned upon
him in a paroxysm of insane rage, and a struggle took place
between them for the possession of the knife, witness calling
for help. Witness did not succeed in wresting the knife
from the hands of deceased; it required all his strength
to keep himself from bodily harm. In the midst of the
struggle witness heard steps approaching, and again called
for help.</p>

<p>The witness' call was responded to by a voice in broken
English, unintelligible to witness, apparently the voice of a
Chinaman. At the sound of the voice and the approach of
footsteps, the deceased broke from witness, and running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
backward a few steps, plunged the knife into his own breast
and fell. Witness ran to his side and again called for help.
Deceased turned upon him with a ghastly smile and said,
"Bring any one here and I'll accuse you before them of my
murder!" Deceased did not speak again, but fell into a
state of insensibility. Witness became alarmed, reflecting
upon the threat of the deceased, and did not go for help.
While standing irresolutely by the body, Mrs. Conroy, the
prisoner's wife, came upon him. Confessed to her the
details just described, and the threat of the deceased. She
advised the instant flight of the witness, and offered to go
with him herself. Witness procured a horse and buggy
from a livery stable, and at half-past nine at night took
Mrs. Conroy from the hillside near the road, where she was
waiting. Drove to Markleville that night, where he left her
under an assumed name, and came alone to San Francisco
and the Mission of San Antonio. Here he learned from
the last witness, the prisoner's sister, Grace Conroy, of the
arrest of her brother for murder. Witness at once returned
to One Horse Gulch, only to find the administration of
justice in the hands of a Vigilance Committee. Feeling
that his own life might be sacrificed without saving the
prisoner's, he took refuge in a tunnel on Conroy's Hill.
It chanced to be the same tunnel which Gabriel Conroy
and his friend afterwards sought in escaping from the Vigilance
Committee after the earthquake. Witness, during the
absence of Gabriel, made himself known to Mr. Jack Hamlin,
Gabriel's friend and comrade in flight, and assured him of
the witness's intention to come forward whenever a fair
trial could be accorded to Gabriel. After the re-arrest and
bailing of Gabriel, witness returned to San Francisco to
procure evidence regarding the forged grant, and proofs of
Ramirez's persecution of Mrs. Conroy. Had brought with
him the knife, and had found the cutler who sold it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
deceased eight months before, when deceased first meditated
an assault on Mrs. Conroy. Objected to, and objection
overruled by a deeply interested and excited Court.</p>

<p>"That is all," said Arthur.</p>

<p>Colonel Starbottle, seated beside Grace Conroy, did not,
for a moment, respond to the impatient eyes of the audience
in the hush that followed. It was not until Grace Conroy
whispered a few words in his ear, that the gallant Colonel
lifted his dilated breast and self-complacent face above the
level of the seated counsel.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;was the reason&mdash;why did the&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;deeply
anxious wife, who fled with you, and thus precipitated
the arrest of her husband&mdash;why did not she return with you to
clear him from suspicion? Why does she remain absent?"</p>

<p>"She was taken ill&mdash;dangerously ill at Markleville. The
excitement and fatigue of the journey had brought on premature
confinement. A child was born"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>There was a sudden stir among the group beside the prisoner's
chair. Colonel Starbottle, with a hurried glance at
Grace Conroy, waved his hand toward the witness and sat
down. Arthur Poinsett rose. "We ask a moment's delay,
your Honour. The prisoner has fallen in a fit."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER VII.</h4>

<h5>A FAMILY GREETING.</h5>


<p>When Gabriel opened his eyes to consciousness, he was
lying on the floor of the jury room, his head supported by
Olly, and a slight, graceful, womanly figure, that had been
apparently bending over him, in the act of slowly withdrawing
from his awakening gaze. It was his sister Grace.</p>

<p>"Thar, you're better now," said Olly, taking her brother's
hand, and quietly ignoring her sister, on whom Gabriel's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
eyes were still fixed. "Try and raise yourself inter this
chair. Thar&mdash;thar now&mdash;that's a good old Gabe&mdash;thar! I
reckon you're more comfortable!"</p>

<p>"It's Gracey!" whispered Gabriel, hoarsely, with his eyes
still fixed upon the slight, elegantly dressed woman, who
now, leaning against the doorway, stood coldly regarding him.
"It's Gracey&mdash;your sister, Olly!"</p>

<p>"Ef you mean the woman who hez been tryin' her best
to swar away your life, and kem here allowin' to do it&mdash;she
ain't no sister o' mine&mdash;not," added Olly, with a withering
glance at the simple elegance of her sister's attire, "not
even ef she does trapse in yer in frills and tuckers&mdash;more
shame for her!"</p>

<p>"If you mean," said Grace, coldly, "the girl whose birthright
you took away by marrying the woman who stole it, if
you mean the girl who rightfully bears the name that you
denied, under oath, in the very shadow of the gallows, she
claims nothing of you but her name."</p>

<p>"Thet's so," said Gabriel, simply. He dropped his head
between his great hands, and a sudden tremor shook his
huge frame.</p>

<p>"Ye ain't goin' to be driv inter histeriks agin along o'
that crockidill," said Olly, bending over her brother in
alarm. "Don't ye&mdash;don't ye cry, Gabe!" whimpered Olly,
as a few drops oozed between Gabriel's fingers; "don't ye
take on, darling, <i>afore her</i>!"</p>

<p>The two sisters glared at each other over the helpless
man between them. Then another woman entered who
looked sympathetically at Gabriel and then glared at them
both. It was Mrs Markle. At which, happily for Gabriel,
the family bickering ceased.</p>

<p>"It's all over, Gabriel! you're clar!" said Mrs.
Markle, ignoring the sympathies as well as the presence of
the two other ladies. "Here's Mr. Poinsett."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span></p>

<p>He entered quickly, but stopped and flushed slightly
under the cold eyes of Grace Conroy. But only for a
moment. Coming to Gabriel's side, he said, kindly,
"Gabriel, I congratulate you. The acting District Attorney
has entered a <i>nolle prosequi</i>, and you are discharged."</p>

<p>"Ye mean I kin go?" said Gabriel, suddenly lifting his
face.</p>

<p>"Yes. You are as free as air."</p>

<p>"And ez to <i>her</i>?" asked Gabriel, quickly.</p>

<p>"Who do you mean?" replied Arthur, involuntarily
glancing in the direction of Grace, whose eyes dropped
scornfully before him.</p>

<p>"My wife&mdash;July&mdash;is <i>she</i> clar too?"</p>

<p>"As far as this trial is concerned, yes," returned Arthur,
with a trifle less interest in his voice, which Gabriel was
quick to discern.</p>

<p>"Then I'll go," said Gabriel, rising to his feet. He
made a few steps to the door and then hesitated, stopped,
and turned toward Grace. As he did so his old apologetic,
troubled, diffident manner returned.</p>

<p>"Ye'll exkoos me, miss," he said, looking with troubled
eyes upon his newly-found sister, "ye'll exkoos me, ef I
haven't the time now to do the agreeable and show ye over
yer property on Conroy's Hill. But it's thar! It's all thar,
ez Lawyer Maxwell kin testify. It's all thar and the house
is open, ez it always was to ye, ez the young woman who
keeps the house kin tell ye. I'd go thar with ye ef I hed
time, but I'm startin' out now, to-night, to see July. To
see my wife, Miss Conroy, to see July ez is expectin'! And
I reckon thar'll be a baby&mdash;a pore little, helpless newborn
baby&mdash;ony <i>so</i> long!" added Gabriel, exhibiting his forefinger
as a degree of mensuration; "and ez a fammerly man,
being ladies, I reckon you reckon I oughter be thar." (I
grieve to state that at this moment the ladies appealed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
exchanged a glance of supreme contempt, and am proud to
record that Lawyer Maxwell and Mr. Poinsett exhibited
the only expression of sympathy with the speaker that was
noticeable in the group.)</p>

<p>Arthur detected it and said, I fear none the less readily
for that knowledge&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't let us keep you, Gabriel; we understand your
feelings. Go at once."</p>

<p>"Take me along, Gabe," said Olly, flashing her eyes at her
sister, and then turning to Gabriel with a quivering upper lip.</p>

<p>Gabriel turned, swooped his tremendous arm around Olly,
lifted her bodily off her feet, and saying, "You're my own
little girl," vanished through the doorway.</p>

<p>This movement reduced the group to Mrs. Markle and
Grace Conroy, confronted by Mr. Poinsett and Maxwell.
Mrs. Markle relieved an embarrassing silence by stepping
forward and taking the arm of Lawyer Maxwell and leading
him away. Arthur and Grace were left alone.</p>

<p>For the first time in his life Arthur lost his readiness
and self-command. He glanced awkwardly at the woman
before him, and felt that neither conventional courtesy
nor vague sentimental recollection would be effective here.</p>

<p>"I am waiting for my maid," said Grace, coldly; "if,
as you return to the Court-room, you will send her here,
you will oblige me."</p>

<p>Arthur bowed confusedly.</p>

<p>"Your maid"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes; you know her, I think, Mr. Poinsett," continued
Grace, lifting her arched brows with cold surprise.
"Manuela!"</p>

<p>Arthur turned pale and red. He was conscious of being
not only awkward but ridiculous.</p>

<p>"Pardon me&mdash;perhaps I am troubling you&mdash;I will go
myself," said Grace, contemptuously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span></p>

<p>"One moment, Miss Conroy," said Arthur, instinctively
stepping before her as she moved as if to pass him, "one
moment, I beg." He paused, and then said, with less
deliberation and more impulsively than had been his habit
for the last six years, "You will, perhaps, be more forgiving
to your brother if you know that I, who have had the
pleasure of meeting you since&mdash;you were lost to us all&mdash;I,
who have not had his pre-occupation of interest in another&mdash;even
I, have been as blind, as foolish, as seemingly
heartless as he. You will remember this, Miss Conroy&mdash;I
hope quite as much for its implied compliment to your
complete disguise, and an evidence of the success of your
own endeavours to obliterate your identity, as for its being
an excuse for your brother's conduct, if not for my own. <i>I</i>
did not know you."</p>

<p>Grace Conroy paused and raised her dark eyes to his.</p>

<p>"You spoke of my brother's pre-occupation with&mdash;with
the woman for whom he would have sacrificed anything&mdash;<i>me</i>&mdash;his
very life! I can&mdash;I am a woman&mdash;I can understand
<i>that</i>! You have forgotten, Don Arturo, you have
forgotten&mdash;pardon me&mdash;I am not finding fault&mdash;it is not for
me to find fault&mdash;but you have forgotten&mdash;Donna Maria
Sepulvida!"</p>

<p>She swept by him with a rustle of silk and lace, and was
gone. His heart gave a sudden bound; he was about to
follow her, when he was met at the door by the expanding
bosom of Colonel Starbottle.</p>

<p>"Permit me, sir, as a gentleman, as a man of&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;honour!
to congratulate you, sir! When we&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;parted
in San Francisco I did not think that I would
have the&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;pleasure&mdash;a rare pleasure to Colonel
Starbottle, sir, in his private as well as his&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;public
capacity, of&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;a <span class="smcap">PUBLIC APOLOGY</span>. Ged, sir! I have
made it! Ged, sir! when I entered that <i>nolle pros.</i>, I said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
to myself, 'Star., this is an apology&mdash;an apology, sir!
But you are responsible, sir, you are responsible, Star.!
personally responsible!'"</p>

<p>"I thank you," said Arthur, abstractedly, still straining
his eyes after the retreating figure of Grace Conroy, and
trying to combat a sudden instinctive jealously of the man
before him, "I thank you, Colonel, on behalf of my client
and myself."</p>

<p>"Ged, sir," said Colonel Starbottle, blocking up the way,
with a general expansiveness of demeanour, "Ged, sir, this
is not all. You will remember that our recent interview in
San Francisco was regarding another and a different issue.
That, sir, I am proud to say, the developments of evidence
in this trial have honourably and&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;as a lawyer, I
may say, have legally settled. With the&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;identification
and legal&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;rehabilitation of Grace Conroy,
that claim of my client falls to the ground. You may state
to your client, Mr. Poinsett, that&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;upon my own
personal responsibility I abandon the claim."</p>

<p>Arthur Poinsett stopped and looked fixedly at the gallant
Colonel. Even in his sentimental pre-occupation the professional
habit triumphed.</p>

<p>"You withdraw Mrs. Dumphy's claim upon Mr.
Dumphy?" he said, slowly.</p>

<p>Colonel Starbottle did not verbally reply, but that gallant
warrior allowed the facial muscles on the left side of his
face to relax so that one eye was partially closed.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir,&mdash;there is a matter of a few thousand dollars
that&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;you understand, I am&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;personally
responsible for."</p>

<p>"That will never be claimed, Colonel Starbottle," said
Arthur, smiling, "and I am only echoing, I am sure, the
sentiments of the man most concerned, who is approaching
us&mdash;Mr. Dumphy."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER VIII.</h4>

<h5>IN WHICH THE FOOTPRINTS RETURN.</h5>


<p>Mr. Jack Hamlin was in very bad case. When Dr.
Duchesne, who had been summoned from Sacramento,
arrived, that eminent surgeon had instantly assumed such
light-heartedness and levity toward his patient, such captiousness
toward Pete, with an occasional seriousness of
demeanour when he was alone, that, to those who knew
him, it was equal to an unfavourable prognosis. Indeed,
he evaded the direct questioning of Olly, who had lately
constituted herself a wondrously light-footed, soft-handed
assistant of Pete, until one day, when they were alone, he
asked more seriously than was his wont if Mr. Hamlin had
ever spoken of his relations, or if she knew of any of his
friends who were accessible.</p>

<p>Olly had already turned this subject over in her womanly
mind, and had thought once or twice of writing to the Blue
Moselle, but on the direct questioning of the doctor, and
its peculiar significance, she recalled Jack's confidences on
their midnight ride, and the Spanish beauty he had outlined;
and so one evening, when she was alone with her
patient, and the fever was low, and Jack lay ominously
patient and submissive, she began&mdash;what the doctor had
only lately abandoned&mdash;probing a half-healed wound.</p>

<p>"I reckon you'd hev been a heap more comfortable ef
this thing hed happened to ye down thar in San Antonio,"
said Olly.</p>

<p>Jack rolled his dark eyes wonderingly upon his fair
persecutor.</p>

<p>"You know you'd hev had thet thar sweetheart o' yours&mdash;thet
Mexican woman&mdash;sittin' by ye, instead o' me&mdash;and
Pete," suggested the artful Olympia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack nearly leaped from the bed.</p>

<p>"Do you reckon I'd hev rung myself in as a wandering
cripple&mdash;a tramp thet hed got peppered&mdash;on a lady like
<i>her</i>? Look yer, Olly," continued Mr. Hamlin, raising
himself on his elbow, "if you've got the idea thet thet
woman is one of them hospital sharps&mdash;one of them angels
who waltz round a sick man with a bottle of camphor in
one hand and a tract in the other&mdash;you had better disabuse
your mind of it at once, Miss Conroy; take a back seat
and wait for a new deal. And don't you go to talkin' of
thet lady as my sweetheart&mdash;it's&mdash;it's&mdash;sacrilegious&mdash;and
the meanest kind of a bluff."</p>

<p>As the day of the trial drew near, Mr. Hamlin had expressed
but little interest in it, and had evidently only withheld
his general disgust of Gabriel's weakness from consideration
of his sister. Once Mr. Hamlin condescended
to explain his apparent coldness.</p>

<p>"There's a witness coming, Olly, that'll clear your brother&mdash;more
shame for him&mdash;the man ez <i>did</i> kill Ramirez. I'm
keeping my sympathies for that chap. Don't you be
alarmed. If that man don't come up to the scratch I will.
So&mdash;don't you go whining round. And ef you'll take my
advice, you'll keep clear o' that Court, and let them lawyers
fight it out. It will be time enough for you to go when
they send for <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"But you can't move&mdash;you ain't strong enough," said
Olly.</p>

<p>"I reckon Pete will get me there some way, if he has to
pack me on his back. I ain't a heavy weight now," said
Jack, looking sadly at his thin white hands; "I've reckoned
on that, and even if I should pass in my checks, there's an
affidavit already sworn to in Maxwell's hands."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, on the day of the trial, Olly, still doubtful
of Gabriel, and still mindful of his capacity to develop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
"God-forsaken mulishness," was nervous and uneasy, until
a messenger arrived from Maxwell with a note to Hamlin,
carrying the tidings of the appearance of Perkins in Court,
and closing with a request for Olly's presence.</p>

<p>"Who's Perkins?" asked Olly, as she reached for her
hat in nervous excitement.</p>

<p>"He's no slouch," said Jack, sententiously. "Don't
ask questions. It's all right with Gabriel now," he added,
assuringly. "He's as good as clear. Run away, Miss
Conroy. Hold up a minit! There, kiss me! Look
here, Olly, say!&mdash;do you take any stock in that lost sister
of yours that your fool of a brother is always gabbing
about? You do? Well, you are as big a fool as he.
There! There!&mdash;never mind now&mdash;she's turned up at
last! Much good may it do you. One! two!&mdash;go!"
and as Olly's pink ribbons flashed through the doorway,
Mr. Hamlin lay down again with a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>He was alone. The house was very quiet and still;
most of the guests, and the hostess and her assistant, were
at the all-absorbing trial; even the faithful Pete, unconscious
of any possible defection of his assistant, Olly, had
taken the opportunity to steal away to hear the arguments
of counsel. As the retreating footsteps of Olly echoed
along the vacant corridor, he felt that he possessed the
house completely.</p>

<p>This consciousness to a naturally active man, bored by
illness and the continuous presence of attendants, however
kind and devoted, was at first a relief. Mr. Hamlin
experienced an instant desire to get up and dress himself,
to do various things which were forbidden&mdash;but which now
an overruling Providence had apparently placed within his
reach. He rose with great difficulty, and a physical weakness
that seemed altogether inconsistent with the excitement
he was then feeling, and partially dressed himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
Then he was suddenly overtaken with great faintness and
vertigo, and struggling to the open window, fell in a chair
beside it. The cool breeze revived him for a moment, and
he tried to rise, but found it impossible. Then the faintness
and vertigo returned, and he seemed to be slipping away
somewhere&mdash;not altogether unpleasantly, nor against his
volition&mdash;somewhere where there was darkness and stillness
and rest. And then he slipped back, almost instantly as it
seemed to him, to a room full of excited and anxious people,
all extravagantly, and as he thought, ridiculously concerned
about himself. He tried to assure them that he was all
right, and not feeling any worse for his exertion, but was
unable to make them understand him. Then followed
Night, replete with pain, and filled with familiar voices that
spoke unintelligibly, and then Day, devoted to the monotonous
repetition of the last word or phrase that the doctor,
or Pete, or Olly had used, or the endless procession of
Olly's pink ribbons, and the tremulousness of a window
curtain, or the black, sphinx-like riddle of a pattern on the
bed-quilt or the wall-paper. Then there was sleep that
was turbulent and conscious, and wakefulness that was
lethargic and dim, and then infinite weariness, and then
lapses of utter vacuity&mdash;the occasional ominous impinging
of the shadow of death.</p>

<p>But through this chaos there was always a dominant
central figure&mdash;a figure partly a memory, and, as such,
surrounded by consistent associations; partly a reality and
incongruous with its surroundings&mdash;the figure of Donna
Dolores! But whether this figure came back to Mr.
Hamlin out of the dusky arches of the Mission Church in
a cloud of incense, besprinkling him with holy water, or
whether it bent over him, touching his feverish lips with
cool drinks, or smoothing his pillow, a fact utterly unreal
and preposterous seen against the pattern of the wall-paper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
or sitting on the familiar chair by his bedside&mdash;it was
always there. And when, one day, the figure stayed
longer, and the interval of complete consciousness seemed
more protracted, Mr. Hamlin, with one mighty effort,
moved his lips, and said feebly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Donna Dolores!"</p>

<p>The figure started, leaned its beautiful face, blushing a
celestial rosy red, above his own, put its finger to its
perfect lips, and said in plain English&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hush! I am Gabriel Conroy's sister."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER IX.</h4>

<h5>IN WHICH MR. HAMLIN PASSES.</h5>


<p>With his lips sealed by the positive mandate of the lovely
spectre, Mr. Hamlin resigned himself again to weakness
and sleep. When he awoke, Olly was sitting by his bedside;
the dusky figure of Pete, spectacled and reading a
good book, was dimly outlined against the window&mdash;but
that was all. The vision&mdash;if vision it was&mdash;had fled.</p>

<p>"Olly," said Mr. Hamlin, faintly.</p>

<p>"Yes!" said Olly, opening her eyes in expectant
sympathy.</p>

<p>"How long have I been dr&mdash;I mean how long has
this&mdash;spell lasted?"</p>

<p>"Three days," said Olly.</p>

<p>"The &mdash;&mdash; you say!" (A humane and possibly weak consideration
for Mr. Hamlin in his new weakness and suffering
restricts me to a mere outline of his extravagance of
speech.)</p>

<p>"But you're better now," supplemented Olly.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamlin began to wonder faintly if his painful experience
of the last twenty-four hours were a part of his convalsecence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
He was silent for a few moments and then
suddenly turned his face toward Olly.</p>

<p>"Didn't you say something about&mdash;about&mdash;your sister,
the other day?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;she's got back," said Olly, curtly.</p>

<p>"Here?"</p>

<p>"Here."</p>

<p>"Well?" said Mr. Hamlin, a little impatiently.</p>

<p>"Well," returned Olly, with a slight toss of her curls,
"she's got back and I reckon it's about time she did."</p>

<p>Strange to say, Olly's evident lack of appreciation of her
sister seemed to please Mr. Hamlin&mdash;possibly because it
agreed with his own idea of Grace's superiority and his
inability to recognise or accept her as the sister of Gabriel.</p>

<p>"Where has she been all this while?" asked Jack,
rolling his large hollow eyes over Olly.</p>

<p>"Goodness knows! Says she's bin livin' in some
fammerly down in the South&mdash;Spanish, I reckon; thet's
whar she gits those airs and graces."</p>

<p>"Has she ever been here&mdash;in this room?" asked Mr.
Hamlin.</p>

<p>"Of course she has," said Olly. "When I left you to go
with Gabe to see his wife at Wingdam, she volunteered to
take my place. Thet waz while you waz flighty, Mr.
Hamlin. But I reckon she admired to stay here on account
of seein' her bo!"</p>

<p>"Her what?" asked Mr. Hamlin, feeling the blood fast
rushing to his colourless face.</p>

<p>"Her bo," repeated Olly, "thet thar Ashley, or Poinsett&mdash;or
whatever he calls hisself now!"</p>

<p>Mr. Hamlin here looked so singular, and his hand tightened
so strongly around Olly's, that she hurriedly repeated
to him the story of Grace's early wanderings, and her absorbing
passion for their former associate, Arthur Poinsett.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
The statement was, in Olly's present state of mind, not
favourable to Grace. "And she just came up yer only to
see Arthur agin. Thet's all. And she nearly swearin' her
brother's life away&mdash;and pretendin' it was only done to save
the fammerly name. Jest ez if it hed been any more comfortable
fur Gabriel to have been hung in his own name.
And then goin' and accusin' thet innocent ole lamb, Gabe,
of conspiring with July to take her name away. Purty goin's
on, I reckon. And thet man Poinsett, by her own showin'&mdash;never
lettin' on to see her nor us&mdash;nor anybody. And
she sassin' <i>me</i> for givin' my opinion of him&mdash;and excusin'
him by sayin' she didn't want him to know <i>whar</i> she was.
And she refusin' to see July at all&mdash;and pore July lyin'
thar at Wingdam, sick with a new baby. Don't talk to me
about her!"</p>

<p>"But your sister didn't run away with&mdash;with&mdash;this chap.
She went away to bring you help," interrupted Jack, hastily
dragging Olly back to earlier history.</p>

<p>"Did she? Couldn't she trust her bo to go and get help
and then come back fur her?&mdash;reckonin' he cared for her
at all. No, she waz thet crazy after him she couldn't trust
him outer her sight&mdash;and she left the camp and Gabe and
ME for him. And then the idee of <i>her</i> talking to Gabriel
about bein' disgraced by July. Ez ef she had never done
anythin' to spile her own name, and puttin' on such airs
and"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dry up!" shouted Mr. Hamlin, turning with sudden
savageness upon his pillow. "Dry up!&mdash;don't you see
you're driving me half-crazy with your infernal buzzing?"
He paused, as Olly stopped in mingled mortification and
alarm, and then added in milder tones, "There, that'll do.
I am not feeling well to-day. Send Dr. Duchesne to me if
he's here. Stop one moment&mdash;there! good-bye, go!"</p>

<p>Olly had risen promptly. There was always something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
in Mr. Hamlin's positive tones that commanded an obedience
that she would have refused to any other. Thoroughly
convinced of some important change in Mr. Hamlin's
symptoms, she sought the doctor at once. Perhaps she
brought with her some of her alarm and anxiety, for a moment
later that distinguished physician entered with less
deliberation than was his habit. He walked to the bedside
of his patient, and would have taken his hand, but Jack
slipped his tell-tale pulse under the covers, and looking
fixedly at the doctor, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Can I be moved from here?"</p>

<p>"You can, but I should hardly advise"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I didn't ask that. This is a lone hand I'm playin',
doctor, and if I'm euchred, tain't your fault. How soon?"</p>

<p>"I should say," said Dr. Duchesne, with professional
caution, "that if no bad symptoms supervene" (he made
here a half habitual but wholly ineffectual dive for Jack's
pulse), "you might go in a week."</p>

<p>"I must go <i>now</i>!"</p>

<p>Dr. Duchesne bent over his patient. He was a quick as
well as a patiently observing man, and he saw something in
Jack's face that no one else had detected. Seeing this he
said, "You can go now, at a great risk&mdash;the risk of your life."</p>

<p>"I'll take it!" said Mr. Hamlin, promptly. "I've been
playin' agin odds," he added, with a faint but audacious
smile, "for the last six months, and it's no time to draw out
now. Go on, tell Pete to pack up and get me ready."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked the doctor, quietly, still
gazing at his patient.</p>

<p>"To!&mdash;blank!" said Mr. Hamlin, impulsively. Then
recognising the fact that in view of his having travelling companions,
some more definite and practicable locality was
necessary, he paused a moment, and said, "To the Mission
of San Antonio."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very well," said the doctor, gravely.</p>

<p>Strange to say, whether from the doctor's medication, or
from the stimulus of some reserved vitality hitherto unsuspected,
Mr. Hamlin from that moment rallied. The preparations
for his departure were quickly made, and in a few
hours he was ready for the road.</p>

<p>"I don't want to have anybody cacklin' around me," he
said, in deprecation of any leave-taking. "I leave the
board, they can go on with the game."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding which, at the last moment, Gabriel
hung awkwardly and heavily around the carriage in which
the invalid was seated.</p>

<p>"I'd foller arter ye, Mr. Hamlin, in a buggy," he interpolated,
in gentle deprecation of his unwieldy and difficult
bulk, "but I'm sorter kept yer with my wife&mdash;who is
powerful weak along of a pore small baby&mdash;about so long&mdash;the
same not bein' a fammerly man yourself, you don't
kinder get the hang of. I thought it might please ye to
know that I got bail yesterday for thet Mr. Perkins&mdash;ez
didn't kill that thar Ramirez&mdash;the same havin' killed hisself&mdash;ez
waz fetched out on the trial, which I reckon ye didn't
get to hear. I admire to see ye lookin' so well, Mr.
Hamlin, and I'm glad Olly's goin' with ye. I reckon
Grace would hev gone too, but she's sorter skary about
strangers, hevin' bin engaged these seving years to a young
man by the name o' Poinsett ez waz one o' my counsel,
and hevin' lately had a row with the same&mdash;one o' them
lovers' fights&mdash;which bein' a young man yourself, ye kin
kindly allow for."</p>

<p>"Drive on!" imprecated Mr. Hamlin furiously to the
driver; "what are you waiting for?" and with the whirling
wheels Gabriel dropped off apologetically in a cloud of
dust, and Mr. Hamlin sack back exhaustedly on the
cushions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding, as he increased his distance from One
Horse Gulch, his spirits seemed to rise, and by the time
they had reached San Antonio he had recovered his old
audacity and dash of manner, and raised the highest hopes
in the breast of everybody but&mdash;his doctor. Yet that
gentleman, after a careful examination of his patient one
night, said privately to Pete, "I think this exaltation will
last about three days longer. I am going to San Francisco.
At the end of that time I shall return&mdash;unless you telegraph
to me before that." He parted gaily from his patient, and
seriously from everybody else. Before he left he sought
out Padre Felipe. "I have a patient here, in a critical
condition," said the doctor; "the hotel is no place for
him. Is there any family here&mdash;any house that will receive
him under your advice for a week? At the end of that
time he will be better, or beyond <i>our</i> ministration. He is
not a Protestant&mdash;he is nothing. You have had experience
with the heathen, Father Felipe."</p>

<p>Father Felipe looked at Dr. Duchesne. The doctor's
well-earned professional fame had penetrated even San
Antonio; the doctor's insight and intelligence were visible
in his manner, and touched the Jesuit instantly. "It is
a strange case, my son; a sad case," he said, thoughtfully.
"I will see."</p>

<p>He did. The next day, under the direction of Father
Felipe, Mr. Hamlin was removed to the Rancho of the
Blessed Fisherman, and notwithstanding the fact that its
hostess was absent, was fairly installed as its guest. When
Mrs. Sepulvida returned from her visit to San Francisco,
she was at first astonished, then excited, and then, I fear,
gratified.</p>

<p>For she at once recognised in this guest of Father Felipe
the mysterious stranger whom she had, some weeks ago,
detected on the plains of the Blessed Trinity. And Jack,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
despite his illness, was still handsome, and had, moreover,
the melancholy graces of invalidism, which go far with an
habitually ailing sex. And so she coddled Mr. Hamlin,
and gave him her sacred hammock by day over the porch,
and her best bedroom at night. And then, at the close of
a pleasant day, she said, archly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think I have seen you before, Mr. Hamlin&mdash;at the
Rancho of the Blessed Trinity. You remember&mdash;the house
of Donna Dolores?"</p>

<p>Mr. Hamlin was too observant of the sex to be impertinently
mindful of another woman than his interlocutor,
and assented with easy indifference.</p>

<p>Donna Maria (now thoroughly convinced that Mr.
Hamlin's attentions on that eventful occasion were intended
for herself, and even delightfully suspicious of some pre-arranged
plan in his present situation): "Poor Donna
Dolores! You know we have lost her for ever."</p>

<p>Mr. Hamlin asked, "When?"</p>

<p>"That dreadful earthquake on the 8th."</p>

<p>Mr. Hamlin, reflecting that the appearance of Grace
Conroy was on the 10th, assented again abstractly.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes! so sad! And yet, perhaps, for the best.
You know the poor girl had a hopeless passion for her
legal adviser&mdash;the famous Arthur Poinsett! Ah! you did
not? Well, perhaps it was only merciful that she died
before she knew how insincere that man's attentions
were. You are a believer in special Providences, Mr.
Hamlin?"</p>

<p>Mr. Hamlin (doubtfully): "You mean a run of
luck?"</p>

<p>Donna Maria (rapidly, ignoring Mr. Hamlin's illustration):
"Well, perhaps <i>I</i> have reason to say so. Poor
Donna Dolores was my friend. Yet, would you believe
there were people&mdash;you know how ridiculous is the gossip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
of a town like this&mdash;there are people who believed that he
was paying attention to ME!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Sepulvida hung her head archly. There was a
long pause. Then Mr. Hamlin called faintly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pete!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mars Jack."</p>

<p>"Ain't it time to take that medicine?"</p>

<p>When Dr. Duchesne returned he ignored all this little
byplay, and even the anxious inquiries of Olly, and said to
Mr. Hamlin&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have you any objection to my sending for Dr. Mackintosh&mdash;a
devilish clever fellow?"</p>

<p>And Mr. Hamlin had none. And so, after a private
telegram, Dr. Mackintosh arrived, and for three or four
hours the two doctors talked in an apparently unintelligible
language, chiefly about a person whom Mr. Hamlin
was satisfied did not exist. And when Dr. Mackintosh
left, Dr. Duchesne, after a very earnest conversation with
him on their way to the stage office, drew a chair beside
Mr. Hamlin's bed.</p>

<p>"Jack!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Have you got everything fixed&mdash;all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Jack!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You've made Pete very happy this morning."</p>

<p>Jack looked up at Dr. Duchesne's critical face, and the
doctor went on gravely&mdash;</p>

<p>"Confessing religion to him&mdash;saying you believed as he
did!"</p>

<p>A faint laugh glimmered in the dark hollows of Jack's
eyes.</p>

<p>"The old man," he said, explanatory, "has been preachin'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
mighty heavy at me ever since t'other doctor came, and I
reckoned it might please him to allow that everything he
said was so. You see the old man's bin right soft on me,
and between us, doctor, I ain't much to give him in exchange.
It's no square game!"</p>

<p>"Then you believe you're going to die?" said the
doctor, gravely.</p>

<p>"I reckon."</p>

<p>"And you have no directions to give me?"</p>

<p>"There's a black hound at Sacramento&mdash;Jim Briggs,
who borrowed and never gave back my silver-mounted
Derringers, that I reckoned to give to you! Tell him
he'd better give them up or I'll"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Jack," interrupted Dr. Duchesne, with infinite gentleness,
laying his hand on the invalid's arm, "you must not
think of me."</p>

<p>Jack pressed his friend's hand.</p>

<p>"There's my diamond pin up the spout at Wingdam,
and the money gone to Lawyer Maxwell to pay witnesses
for that old fool Gabriel. And then when Gabriel and me
was escaping I happened to strike the very man, Perkins,
who was Gabriel's principal witness, and he was dead
broke, and I had to give him my solitaire ring to help him
get away and be on hand for Gabriel. And Olly's got my
gold specimen to be made into a mug for that cub of that
old she tiger&mdash;Gabriel's woman&mdash;that Madame Devarges.
And my watch&mdash;who <i>has</i> got my watch?" said Mr.
Hamlin, reflectively.</p>

<p>"Never mind those things, Jack. Have you any word
to send&mdash;to&mdash;anybody?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>There was a long pause. In the stillness the ticking of
a clock on the mantel became audible. Then there was a
laugh in the ante-room, where a professional brother of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
Jack's had been waiting, slightly under the influence of
grief and liquor.</p>

<p>"Scotty ought to know better than to kick up a row
in a decent woman's house," whispered Jack, faintly.
"Tell him to dry up, or I'll"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But his voice was failing him, and the sentence remained
incomplete.</p>

<p>"Doc&mdash;&mdash;" (after a long effort).</p>

<p>"Jack."</p>

<p>"Don't&mdash;let&mdash;on&mdash;to Pete&mdash;I fooled&mdash;him."</p>

<p>"No, Jack."</p>

<p>They were both still for several minutes. And then Dr.
Duchesne softly released his hand and laid that of his
patient, white and thin, upon the coverlid before him.
Then he rose gently and opened the door of the ante-room.
Two or three eager faces confronted him. "Pete,"
he said, gravely, "I want Pete&mdash;no one else."</p>

<p>The old negro entered with a trembling step. And then
catching sight of the white face on the pillow, he uttered
one cry&mdash;a cry replete with all the hysterical pathos of his
race, and ran and dropped on his knees beside&mdash;it! And
then the black and the white face were near together, and
both were wet with tears.</p>

<p>Dr. Duchesne stepped forward and would have laid his
hand gently upon the old servant's shoulder. But he
stopped, for suddenly both of the black hands were lifted
wildly in the air, and the black face with rapt eyeballs
turned toward the ceiling, as if they had caught sight of the
steadfast blue beyond. Perhaps they had.</p>

<p>"O de Lord God! whose prechiss blood washes de
brack sheep and de white sheep all de one colour! O de
Lamb ob God! Sabe, sabe dis por', dis por' boy. O
Lord God, for MY sake. O de Lord God, dow knowst fo'

de same to you, let all dat go fo' nowt. Let ole Pete go!
and send down dy mercy and forgiveness fo' <i>him</i>!"</p>

<h4>CHAPTER X.</h4>

<h5>IN THE OLD CABIN AGAIN.</h5>


<p>There was little difficulty in establishing the validity of
Grace Conroy's claim to the Conroy grant under the bequest
of Dr. Devarges. Her identity was confirmed by
Mr. Dumphy&mdash;none the less readily that it relieved him of
a distressing doubt about the late Mrs. Dumphy, and did
not affect his claim to the mineral discovery which he had
purchased from Gabriel and his wife. It was true that
since the dropping of the lead the mine had been virtually
abandoned, and was comparatively of little market value.
But Mr. Dumphy still clung to the hope that the missing
lead would be discovered.</p>

<p>He was right. It was some weeks after the death of
Mr. Hamlin that Gabriel and Olly stood again beneath the
dismantled roof-tree and bare walls of his old cabin on
Conroy Hill. But the visit this time was not one of confidential
disclosure nor lonely contemplation, but with a
practical view of determining whether this first home of
the brother and sister could be repaired and made habitable,
for Gabriel had steadily refused the solicitations of
Grace that he should occupy his more recent mansion.
Mrs. Conroy and infant were at the hotel.</p>

<p>"Thar, Olly," said Gabriel, "I reckon that a cartload o'
boards and a few days' work with willin' hands, will put
that thar shanty back ag'in ez it used to be when you and
me waz childun."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Olly, abstractedly.</p>

<p>"We've had good times yer, Olly, you and me!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Olly, with eyes still afar.</p>

<p>Gabriel looked down&mdash;a great way&mdash;on his sister, and
then suddenly took her hand and sat down upon the doorstep,
drawing her between his knees after the old fashion.</p>

<p>"Ye ain't hearkenin' to me, Olly dear!"</p>

<p>Whereat Miss Olympia instantly and illogically burst into
tears, and threw her small arms about Gabriel's huge bulk.
She had been capricious and fretful since Mr. Hamlin's
death, and it may be that she embraced the dead man
again in her brother's arms. Hut her outward expression
was, "Gracey! I was thinking o' poor Gracey, Gabe!"</p>

<p>"Then," said Gabriel, with intense archness and cunning,
"you was thinkin' o' present kempany, for ef I ain't blind,
that's them coming up the hill."</p>

<p>There were two figures slowly coming up the hill outlined
against the rosy sunset. A man and woman&mdash;Arthur
Poinsett and Grace Conroy. Olly lifted her head and rose
to her feet. They approached nearer. No one spoke.
The next instant&mdash;impulsively I admit, inconsistently I protest&mdash;the
sisters were in each other's arms. The two men
looked at each other, awkward, reticent, superior.</p>

<p>Then the women having made quick work of it, the two
men were treated to an equally illogical, inconsistent embrace.
When Grace at last, crying and laughing, released
Gabriel's neck from her sweet arms, Mr. Poinsett assumed
the masculine attitude of pure reason.</p>

<p>"Now that you have found your sister, permit me to introduce
you to my wife," he said to Gabriel, taking Grace's
hand in his own.</p>

<p>Whereat Olly flew into Poinsett's arms, and gave him a
fraternal and conciliatory kiss. Tableau.</p>

<p>"You don't look like a bride," said the practical Olly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
Mrs. Poinsett, under her breath; "you ain't got no veil, no
orange blossoms&mdash;and that black dress"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"We've been married seven years, Olly," said the quick-eared
and ready-witted Arthur.</p>

<p>And then these people began to chatter as if they had
always been in the closest confidence and communion.</p>

<p>"You know," said Grace to her brother, "Arthur and I
are going East, to the States, to-morrow, and really, Gabe,
he says he will not leave here until you consent to take back
your house&mdash;your wife's house, Gabe. You know WE"
(there was a tremendous significance in this newly-found
personal plural), "WE have deeded it all to you."</p>

<p>"I hev a dooty to per-form to Gracey," said Gabriel Conroy,
with astute deliberation, looking at Mr. Poinsett, "a
dooty to thet gal, thet must be done afore any transfer of
this yer proputty is made. I hev to make restitution of
certain papers ez hez fallen casooally into my hands. This
yer paper," he added, drawing a soiled yellow envelope
from his pocket, "kem to me a week ago, the same hevin'
lied in the Express Office sens the trial. It belongs to
Gracey, I reckon, and I hands it to her."</p>

<p>Grace tore open the envelope, glanced at its contents
hurriedly, uttered a slight cry of astonishment, blushed, and
put the paper into her pocket.</p>

<p>"This yer paper," continued Gabriel, gravely, drawing
another from his blouse, "was found by me in the Empire
Tunnel the night I was runnin' from the lynchers. It likewise
b'longs to Gracey&mdash;and the world gin'rally. It's the
record of Dr. Devarges' fust discovery of the silver lead on
this yer hill, and," continued Gabriel, with infinite gravity,
"wipes out, so to speak, this yer mineral right o' me and
Mr. Dumphy and the stockholders gin'rally."</p>

<p>It was Mr. Poinsett's turn to take the paper from
Gabriel's hands. He examined it attentively by the fading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
light. "That is so," he said, earnestly; "it is quite legal
and valid."</p>

<p>"And thar ez one paper more," continued Gabriel, this
time putting his hand in his bosom and drawing out a buckskin
purse, from which he extracted a many-folded paper.
"It's the grant that Dr. Devarges gave Gracey, thet thet
pore Mexican Ramirez ez&mdash;maybe ye may remember&mdash;waz
killed, handed to my wife, and July, my wife"&mdash;said Gabriel,
with a prodigious blush&mdash;"hez been sorter keepin' <span class="smcap">IN
TRUST</span> for Gracey!"</p>

<p>He gave the paper to Arthur, who received it, but still
retained a warm grasp of Gabriel's massive hand.</p>

<p>"And now," added Gabriel, "et's gettin' late, and I reckon
et's about the square thing ef we'd ad-journ this yer
meeting to the hotel, and ez you're goin' away, maybe ye'd
make a partin' visit with yer wife, forgettin' and forgivin'
like, to Mrs. Conroy and the baby&mdash;a pore little thing&mdash;that
ye wouldn't believe it, Mr. Poinsett, looks like me!"</p>

<p>But Olly and Grace had drawn aside, and were in
the midst of an animated conversation. And Grace was
saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"So I took the stone from the fire, just as I take this"
(she picked up a fragment of the crumbling chimney before
her); "it looked black and burnt just like this; and I
rubbed it hard on the blanket so, and it shone, just like
silver, and Dr. Devarges said"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"We are going, Grace," interrupted her husband, "we
are going to see Gabriel's wife." Grace hesitated a moment,
but as her husband took her arm he slightly pressed it with
a certain matrimonial caution, whereupon with a quick
impulsive gesture, Grace held out her hand to Olly, and
the three gaily followed the bowed figure of Gabriel, as he
strode through the darkening woods.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h4>CHAPTER XI.</h4>

<h5>THE RETURN OF A FOOTPRINT.</h5>


<p>I regret that no detailed account of the reconciliatory visit
to Mrs. Conroy has been handed down, and I only gather
a hint of it from after comments of the actors themselves.
When the last words of parting had been said, and Grace
and Arthur had taken their seats in the Wingdam coach,
Gabriel bent over his wife's bedside,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It kinder seemed ez ef you and Mr. Poinsett recognised
each other at first, July," said Gabriel.</p>

<p>"I <i>have</i> seen him before&mdash;not here! I don't think he'll
ever trouble us much, Gabriel," said Mrs. Conroy, with a
certain triumphant lighting of the cold fires of her grey
eyes. "But look at the baby. He's laughing! He
knows you, I declare!" And in Gabriel's rapt astonishment
at this unprecedented display of intelligence in one
so young, the subject was dropped.</p>

<p>"Why, where did you ever see Mrs. Conroy before?"
asked Grace of her husband, when they had reached Wingdam
that night.</p>

<p>"I never saw <i>Mrs. Conroy</i> before," returned Arthur, with
legal precision. "I met a lady in St. Louis years ago under
another name, who, I dare say, is now your brother's wife.
But&mdash;I think, Grace&mdash;the less we see of her&mdash;the better."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"By the way, darling, what was that paper that Gabriel
gave you?" asked Arthur, lightly, avoiding the previous
question.</p>

<p>Grace drew the paper from her pocket, blushed slightly,
kissed her husband, and then putting her arms around his
neck, laid her face in his breast, while he read aloud, in
Spanish, the following:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"This is to give trustworthy statement that on the 18th of May
1848, a young girl, calling herself Grace Conroy, sought shelter and
aid at the Presidio of San Geronimo. Being friendless&mdash;but of the B.
V. M. and the Saints&mdash;I adopted her as my daughter, with the name
of Dolores Salvatierra. Six months after her arrival, on the 12th
of November 1848, she was delivered of a dead child, the son of her
affianced husband, one Philip Ashley. Wishing to keep her secret
from the world and to prevent recognition by the members of her own
race and family, by the assistance and advice of an Indian <i>peon</i>,
Manuela, she consented that her face and hands should be daily
washed by the juice of the <i>Yokoto</i>&mdash;whose effect is to change the skin
to the colour of bronze. With this metamorphosis she became known,
by my advice and consent, as the daughter of the Indian Princess
Nicata and myself. And as such I have recognised in due form her
legal right in the appointment of my estate.</p>

<p>"But how did Gabriel get this?" asked Arthur.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't&mdash;know!" said Grace.</p>

<p>"To whom did <i>you</i> give it?"</p>

<p>"To&mdash;Padre Felipe."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see!" said Arthur. "Then <i>you</i> are Mr.
Dumphy's long-lost wife?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what Father Felipe did," said Grace,
tossing her head slightly. "I put the matter in his hands."</p>

<p>"The whole story?"</p>

<p>"I said nothing about you&mdash;you great goose!"</p>

<p>Arthur kissed her by way of acknowledging the justice
of the epithet.</p>

<p>"But I ought to have told Mrs. Sepulvida the whole
story when she said you proposed to her. You're sure you
didn't?" continued Grace, looking into her husband's eyes.</p>

<p>"Never," said the admirable young man, promptly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span></p>

<h4>CHAPTER XII.</h4>

<h5>FRAGMENT OF A LETTER FROM OLYMPIA CONROY TO
GRACE POINSETT.</h5>


<p>"&mdash;&mdash;the baby is doing well. And only think&mdash;Gabe has
struck it again! And you was the cause, dear&mdash;and he
says it all belongs to you&mdash;like the old mule that he is.
Don't you remember when you was telling me about
Doctor Divergers giving you that rock and how you rubed
it until the silver shone, well, you took up a rock from our
old chimbly and rubed it, while you was telling it. And
thet rock Gabe came across next morning, all shining
where you had rubed it. And shure enuff it was sollid
silver. And then Gabe says, says he, 'We've struck it
agin, fur the chimbly rock was taken from the first hole I
dug on the hill only a hundred feet from here.' And shure
enuff, yesterday he purspected the hole and found the leed
agin. And we are all very ritch agin and comin' to see
you next yeer, only that Gabe is such a fool! Your loving
Sister,</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> I fear I must task the incredulous reader's further patience by
calling attention to what may perhaps prove the most literal and
thoroughly-attested fact of this otherwise fanciful chronicle. The
condition and situation of the ill-famed "Donner Party"&mdash;then an
unknown, unheralded cavalcade of emigrants&mdash;starving in an unfrequented
pass of the Sierras, was first made known to Captain Yount
of Napa, <i>in a dream</i>. The Spanish records of California show that the
relief party which succoured the survivors was projected upon this

<p><i>Consider what you have in the smallest chosen
library. A company of the wisest and wittiest men
that could be picked out of all civil countries, in a thousand
years, have set in best order the results of their
learning and wisdom. The men themselves were hid and
inaccessible, solitary, impatient of interruptions, fenced by
etiquette; but the thought which they did not uncover to
their bosom friend is here written out in transparent
words to us, the strangers of another age.</i>&mdash;Ralph
